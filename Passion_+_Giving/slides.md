* August 9, 2014
* I read a (re)tweet from Angela (now Alex) Harms about a shooting and unrest in Ferguson
* My first thought was "please don't be Ferguson, Missouri"
* An unarmed 18-year-old black kid had been shot and killed by police


* NOTE: This is a recreation of the tweet; I can't find the original

![Collage of news about Mike Brown and Ferguson](images/ferguson-protest-guns-blazing.jpg)

???

* I was glued to the news for a couple weeks
* I cried several times that week
* I was sad
* I was angry
* I felt helpless
* The only difference between me and the rioters was that I was not oppressed
    * I was a part of the system that supported oppression
* So many people were hurting, feeling oppressed

![White construction worker saying "he had his hands up"](TODO - clip from http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/10/us/ferguson-michael-brown-shooting-witnesses/index.html)

???

* Here's why I believe that
    * This witness didn't know he was on video, shortly after the shooting
    * He was a contractor working in the area
    * He says "his fucking hands were up"
* But even if they weren't, police are not judge, jury, and executioner
* There's no good reason to "shoot to kill" an unarmed person

![Phone book - Yellow pages](images/yellow-pages.jpg)

???

* Some of the kids volunteering said they wanted to support local businesses, but they couldn't find them on the web
* And phone books weren't a thing any more
* So they decided to figure out how to teach themselves to make web sites for the mom and pop shops in their community

![Tweet about a GoFundMe page raising money to teach underprivileged kids how to build web sites](images/alex-miller-tweet.png)

???

* Alex Miller tweeted about a GoFundMe page raising money to teach underprivileged kids how to build web sites
* My wife was going to school, so we didn't have much money to give
* But I had time and expertise to share
* It sounded like the perfect role for me
    * It allowed me to apply my experience and skills
    * It felt like something that could make a difference
    * It was so compelling - a calling

* NOTE: This is a recreation of the actual (re)tweet; I couldn't find the original

### Mentoring the kids

* Hard work and lots of hours

OPPORTUNITY

???

* My goal was to give the kids an opportunity that they would not have had otherwise - a chance to learn enough to decide if this was a path for them or not
* Opportunity is the biggest thing missing in most of these kids' lives
* They probably don't have the privilege of knowing anyone in their network, or their parents' network that could introduce them to this as a career path
* I didn't expect a very high chance that any of the kids would pursue this as a career
* But some of the kids continued building websites for small companies in their communities, setting up a small side business
* We gave these kids a chance, and they exceeded our expectations

* That light bulb moment was my story
* I told her that story when we happened to sit at the same table at lunch the next day

COMMUNITY

* The common thread - these are my communities
* Some I chose, some chose me
* I think this country has forgotten how to be a community
* But I see signs of hope

    * Many of us are trying to improve diversity and inclusion

![Approximately 700,000 pixels, representing each hour of my life](images/andy-kroll-pixelated-life.png)

???

* Andy Croll gave a keynote at RubyConf 2017, showing a pixel for every hour of our lives
    * 24 hours/day * 365 days/year * 80 years/life = 700,800 hours
    * Which is pretty close to the number of pixels on a 1024x768 screen (786,432)
        * Which is also about what a (non-retina) phone screen has
* The black pixels on the right represent sleep
* The black pixels on the top represent your childhood
* So you've only got a small number of hours
* So use each pixel wisely
* Find your community
* Find people that are nice and help each other
* Find the place where you can make a difference
* Put in the work, because the rewards are high
    * How you feel about yourself
    * The impact on someone else's life
    * The impact you make to improve the communities you live in
* Make every pixel - every hour - count

---

BLACK LIVES MATTER

???

* Make every person count (whether you've met them or not)
* Reach out to meet people you wouldn't normally cross paths with
* Work to improve our communities
    * This one right here
    * The wider (local) community
    * Our state, our country, our world
