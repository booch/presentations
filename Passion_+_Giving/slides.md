???

* I was glued to the news for a couple weeks
* I cried several times that week
* I was sad
* I was angry
* I felt helpless
* The only difference between me and the rioters was that I was not oppressed
    * I was a part of the system that supported oppression
* So many people were hurting, feeling oppressed

BLACK LIVES MATTER

???

* One of the slogans from the protest movement is "BLACK LIVES MATTER"
* I believe those words to be true

---
class: big-words

BLACK LIVES MATTER AS MUCH AS WHITE LIVES

???

* When we say it, we mean that black lives matter as much as white lives

---
class: big-words

ONLY BLACK LIVES MATTER

???

* Some people think it means this
* But that would be silly for someone like me to believe
* And nobody I know involved in the movement thinks that
* I've asked how people feel about white people participating
* They're happy to have us

![White construction worker saying "he had his hands up"](images/construction-worker.png)

???

* It's clear to me that Mike Brown's hands were up when he was shot
* Here's why I believe that
    * This witness didn't know he was on video, shortly after the shooting
    * He was a contractor working in the area
    * He says "his f'ing hands were up"
* But even if they weren't, police are not judge, jury, and executioner
* There's no good reason to "shoot to kill" an unarmed person


* This is from video at http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/10/us/ferguson-michael-brown-shooting-witnesses/index.html

![Tweet about a GoFundMe page raising money to teach underprivileged kids how to build web sites](images/alex-miller-tweet.png)

???

* Alex Miller tweeted about a GoFundMe page raising money to teach underprivileged kids how to build web sites
* My wife was going to school, so we didn't have much money to give
* But I had time and expertise to share
* It sounded like the perfect role for me
    * It allowed me to apply my experience and skills
    * It felt like something that could make a difference
    * It was so compelling - a calling
* Abby Bobé was the organizer
    * I got in contact with her to help

OPPORTUNITY

???

* My goal was to give the kids an opportunity that they would not have had otherwise
    * A chance to learn enough to decide if this was a path for them or not
* Opportunity is the biggest thing missing in most of these kids' lives
* They probably don't have the privilege of knowing anyone in their network, or their parents' network that could introduce them to this as a career path
* I didn't expect a very high chance that any of the kids would pursue this as a career
* But some of the kids continued building websites for small companies in their communities, setting up a small side business
* We gave these kids a chance, and they exceeded our expectations

* When I went to RubyConf 2017, Heidi Helfand (from ProCore) asked us about a "peak moment" in our lives to share with a neighbor in the audience
    * Her talk was called "Leadership Starts with Listening"
* That light bulb moment was my story
* I told her that story when we happened to sit at the same table at lunch the next day

COMMUNITY

???

* The common thread - these are my communities
* Some I chose, some chose me
* I think this country has forgotten how to be a community
* But I see signs of hope
* The tech community I involve myself in works to make a difference
    * Many of us are trying to improve diversity and inclusion

<div class="life" style="background: white; height: 600px; width: 100%; margin-top: 30px;">&nbsp;</div>

???

* Andy Croll gave a keynote at RubyConf 2017, showing a pixel for every hour of our lives
    * 24 hours/day * 365 days/year * 80 years/life = 700,800 hours
    * Which is pretty close to the number of pixels on a 1024x768 screen (786,432)
        * Which is also about what a (non-retina) phone screen has

---

<div class="life" style="background: white; height: 600px; width: 67%; margin-top: 30px;">&nbsp;</div>

???

* But you're going to sleep 1/3 of that

---

<div class="life" style="background: white; height: 500px; width: 67%; margin-top: 130px;">&nbsp;</div>

???

* And you have to spend some time as a kid, growing up
* So you've only got a small number of hours
* So use each pixel wisely
* Find your community
* Find people that are nice and help each other
* Find the place where you can make a difference
* Put in the work, because the rewards are high
    * How you feel about yourself
    * The impact on someone else's life
    * The impact you make to improve the communities you live in
* Make every pixel - every hour - count

* Work to improve our communities

    * Our state, our country, our world
