# Booleans as Parameters

~~~ ruby
random_object.class
# => User
~~~

???

* When I'm in Rails console, IRB, or Pry, I frequently want to see the class of an object

~~~ ruby
def random_object(cache: true)
  return @random_object if cache && @random_object_defined
  @random_object_defined = true
  random_object_index = Random.rand(ObjectSpace.each_object.count)
  @random_object = ObjectSpace.each_object.drop(random_object_index).take(1)
end
~~~

---

# Booleans as Parameters

~~~ ruby
random_object.methods
# => [:can?, :cannot?, :paper_trail_originator, :paper_trail_enabled_for_model?, :whodunnit]
~~~

???

* Often, I'll also want to see what methods the object can respond to.
* Show of hands - who's familiar with this method named `methods`?
* How many of you (with your hands up) know that it takes an optional parameter?
* How many of you remember whether to pass `true` or `false` to not show methods from superclasses?

---

# Booleans as Parameters

~~~ ruby
random_object.methods(false)
# => [:id, :first_name, :last_name]
~~~

???

* It happens to be `false` for this method.
* But to use it properly, you have to remember that.
* Can we do better?

---

# Booleans as Named Parameters

~~~ ruby
random_object.methods(superclass_methods: false)
# => [:id, :first_name, :last_name]
~~~

???

* The best way to fix this API is to use a named parameter to _describe_ the parameter.
* This method pre-dates named parameters in Ruby, though.
* It also needs to retain backwards compatibility.

---

# Booleans as Named Parameters

~~~ ruby
class Object
  def methods(options = [])
    show_superclass_methods = options &&
                              options.respond_to?(:[]) &&
                              options[:superclass_methods]
    if show_superclass_methods
      show_all_methods_this_object_responds_to
    else
      show_methods_from_immediate_class_of_this_object
    end
  end
end
~~~

???

* In older Ruby versions, we would have to use an options hash to emulate named parameters.
    * TODO: Find references to Avdi and Sandi recommending this technique.
* We still need to use an options hash to support taking a bare Boolean or a Hash.

# Connascence

> _common birth or production of multiple things at the same time_

> _the act of growing together_

???

* We're going to take a short detour here to talk about something called "connascence".
* Definitions are from Webster's dictionary, 1913.

# Connascence

> _measurement of the amount of coupling (dependencies) among components of an OOP software system_

???

* Concept in OOP was first introduced in 1992, by Meilir (may-LEER) Page-Jones.

# Connascence

> _Two pieces of code share connascence when changing one requires a corresponding change in the other._

> _Excessive connascence means the system is hard to change and hard to maintain._

???

* Jim Weirich brought the idea of connascence to the Ruby community in 2009.
    * [Grand Unified Theory of Software Design](https://vimeo.com/10837903)
        * Slides: https://github.com/jimweirich/presentation_connascence
        * Has a very similar example to my `methods` example.
        * Another version of the talk, with better audio, but worse video: https://vimeo.com/10837903
    * [The Building Blocks of Modularity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l780SYuz9DI)
        * Same slides as above, but shown in video; poor audio
    * [Connascence Examined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQXVKHoUQxY) - new talk in 2012
        * Slides: https://github.com/jimweirich/presentation-connascence-examined
    * Makes the argument that connascence underlies many other rules of good OOP design.
        * DRY
        * Code smells
        * Race conditions

# Connascence

* Connascence of Name
* Connascence of Type
* Connascence of Meaning
* Connascence of Position
* Connascence of Algorithm

???

* This is a list of the types of static connascence.
    * There are dynamic types of connascence too.
* Connascence of Name
    * Agreement on the name of something
    * Example: any time we call a method
    * Example: any time we reference a variable or a constant
* Connascence of Type
    * Agreement on the type of something
* Connascence of Meaning
    * Agreement on the meaning or interpretation of specific values
* Connascence of Position
    * Agreement on the order of values
* Connascence of Algorithm
    * Agreement on a particular algorithm
    * Example: encoding/decoding passwords
    * Example: checksum on credit card numbers
* This list is from weakest connascence to strongest.
    * The dynamic types of connascence are all stronger then these.
* If we can replace a stronger form of connascence with a weaker form, we've reduced connascence.
* Increasing locality of connascent components is another way to reduce connascence.
* Note that Connascence of Name is weaker than Connascence of Meaning.

---

# Connascence

~~~ ruby
random_object.methods(false)
~~~

~~~ ruby
random_object.methods(superclass_methods: false)
~~~

???

* That's what we did here.
* We replaced a positional parameter with a named parameter.
* The positional parameter has a specific meaning, which is more difficult to remember.
* We decreased connascence by replacing Connascence of Meaning with Connascence of Name.

# Readability of Predicate Methods

~~~ ruby
def deletable?
  if approvers_enabled?
    !answered?
  else
    true
  end
end
~~~

???

* My friend and colleague Amos Kind came across something like this once.
    * He submitted a pull request to make it more clear.
* We've got a predicate method, based on 2 other predicate methods.
    * _Predicate method_ just means that it returns `true` or `false`.
* Having an explicit `true` or `false` is a bit of a smell.
    * With possible exception of early `return` statements (guard clauses).
* Can we improve this code?

# Boolean Transformations

~~~ ruby
true || x == true       # Identity
false && x == false     # Nullification
x || y == y || x        # Commutation
x && y == y && x        # Commutation
x || !x == true         # Tautology
x && !x == false        # Contradiction
(!x || !y) == !(x && y) # De Morgan's laws
(!x && !y) == !(x || y) # De Morgan's laws
~~~

???

* The Boolean **and** and **or** operators are commutative.
    * Note that Ruby has short-cutting â€” different code might run, depending on order.
* [De Morgan's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan%27s_laws)

# Readability of Predicate Methods

~~~ ruby
def deletable?
  if approvers_enabled?
    !answered?
  else
    true
  end
end
~~~

???

* Now we have tools to refactor this to be more readable.

---

# Readability of Predicate Methods

~~~ ruby
def deletable?
  !approvers_enabled? || !answered?
end
~~~

???

* We can apply some of the transformations to get rid of the `if` and the explicit `true`.

---

# Readability of Predicate Methods

~~~ ruby
def deletable?
  approvers_disabled? || unanswered?
end

def unanswered?
  !answered?
end

def approvers_disabled?
  !approvers_enabled?
end
~~~

???

* We can refactor to extract some methods to make things more clear.
* Don't be afraid to extract methods for sub-expressions.
    * Even if they're used in only 1 place.
    * Even if it's just to invert the _sense_.
