TODO
====

* Add example of method taking 3 different Boolean parameters
* For first example, say that it'd be even better to just have 2 separate methods
* Add indicator to list of types of connascence showing weak/strong
    * Split into 2 slides, first without the indicator
* Add picture of Jim Weirich
* Add pictures of books I mention
* Make sure https://craigbuchek.com/booleans links to slides
* Example of method taking a Boolean that shows SRP violation
* Center short code samples better
* Add a subtle background (to title slide, at the least)
* Maybe find some graphics for title slide
    * Perhaps a picture of George Boole
    * Perhaps a quiz show
    * YES, NO, TRUE, FALSE, 0, 1
