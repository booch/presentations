Booleans are Easy - True or False?
==================================

This is my presentation for [RailsConf 2018][railsconf].


Abstract
--------

Booleans are pretty simple â€” they're either true or false.
But that doesn't mean that they're always easy to use, or that they're always the right choice when they appear to be the obvious choice.

We'll cover several anti-patterns in the use of booleans.
We'll discuss *why* they're problematic, and explore some better alternatives.
