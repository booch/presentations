# Agile Manifesto

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation

# Agile Principle # 12

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
its behavior accordingly.

# Retrospective Prime Directive

Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.
