# Agile Principle # 12

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
its behavior accordingly.

This is the primary mechanism by which teams improve the way they work.

# Retrospective Prime Directive

Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.
