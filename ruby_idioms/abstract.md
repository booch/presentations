Idioms are some of the smallest patterns that we use in our programming languages.
Learning the idioms of a language helps you more quickly understand commonly used patterns.
Over time, some idioms fall out of favor, and new idioms are developed and adopted.

These include:

* Module factory
* Tag module
* Circuit breaker
* Fetch with default block
