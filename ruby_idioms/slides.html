Ruby Idioms You're Not Using Yet
================================

---

About Me
========

Rubyist since 2005

Independent contactor
  * Rails rescue projects
  * Agile techniques

???

Occasional forays working with other languages.
This just makes me appreciate Ruby more.

Always looking for contract work.

---

What Is An Idiom?
=================

1\. An expression that cannot be understood from the meanings of its separate words but that has a separate meaning of its own.

???

First I want to talk briefly about what an idiom is.

The dictionary gives us sevaral definitions.

Most people seem to pick this first definition
when talking about idioms in programming languages.

---

What Is An Idiom?
=================

2\. A style or form of expression that is characteristic of a particular person, type of art, etc.

???

But I think this definition is closer to what we mean.

---

What Is An Idiom?
=================

My definition: A way in which we normally express ourselves in a language.

---

Idiomatic Ruby
==============

~~~ ruby
5.times do
  puts "Craig is great at Ruby"
end
~~~

~~~ ruby
def expiration_dates
  current_year = Date.today.year
  [current_year .. current_year + 20]
end
~~~

???

Here are a couple simple examples of idiomatic Ruby.

I can tell that the person who wrote these is at least somewhat familiar with Ruby.

---

Non-Idiomatic Ruby
==================

~~~ ruby
for i in 1..5
   puts "Craig is great"
end
~~~

~~~ ruby
def expiration_dates
    currentYear = Date.today.year
    i = 0
    dates = []
    while i <= 20
        dates.push(currentYear + i)
        i += 1
    end
    return dates
end
~~~

???

I can tell that these were written by someone not very familiar with Ruby.

Maybe they're "writing Java in Ruby".

Not only is the 2nd one longer,
but it takes more effort for me to understand what it means.

---

Idiom Or Pattern?
=================

What's the difference?

???

Is there a difference? I don't know.

---

Pattern
=======

A template for a common solution to a common problem

???

A pattern is just a template for a common solution to a common problem.

Patterns aren't just for design and architecture level issues.
For example, Kent Beck's "Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns"
talks about patterns at the method level.

So I'm going to treat the 2 terms somewhat interchangably.

---

Why Use Idioms?
===============

They're tools that Ruby gives you

They're tools that Rubyists can help you with

???

They're not necessarily tools that Ruby gives you *on purpose*.

Often, Ruby is optimized to make idiomatic versions work better than non-idiomatic.

---

Memoization
===========

~~~ ruby
def yesterday
  @yesterday ||= Date.today - 1
end
~~~

???

We'll start out with a simple one.

Hopefully most of us here use this one pretty regularly.

If the instance variable is set to something that's not falsey,
then the instance variable will be returned.

Otherwise the calclation will be performed, stored into the instance variable for next time,
and returned.

This won't work well if your caluclation might return false or nil.

---

Memoization
===========

Use to cache "expensive" operations
  * CPU
  * I/O

Don't use without thinking!

???

Sometimes you really do need to recaluclate every time.

In my example on the previous slide,
if your process might run for more than 1 day,
you'll have a bug -- and it'll be hard to track down.

---

Memoization
===========

Use a gem?

What about parameters?

???

There's a gem, but for the basic case, it's not worth bothering.

When you have to cache based on parameters, you'd need to store in a Hash.
This happens a lot less in Ruby -- probably due to extracting objects.

---

Fetch with Default Block
========================

~~~ ruby
RV = ENV["RUBY_VERSION"] || "2.1.4"
RV = ENV.fetch("RUBY_VERSION") # Raises IndexError if not found
RV = ENV.fetch("RUBY_VERSION") { "2.1.4" }
RV = ENV.fetch("RUBY_VERSION") { raise "Must specify RUBY_VERSION" }
~~~

???

This is a simple one.

Also comes from Avdi.

This works for `Hash`es, `Array`s, and `Hash`-like objects, such as `ENV`.

Each has its pros and cons:

* First is easiest, if you know the hash won't contain a `nil` or `false`
  * Or of you don't need to distinguish
* Second is helpful to ensure you don't pass a `nil` around
  * Prevents NoMethodError at a later time
* Third is best for cases where missing, `nil`, and `false` need to be handled differently
* Fourth is good for failing fast and being explicit about how to fix the problem

Avdi's advice is to default to the 3rd over the 1st, unless you think about it.

http://devblog.avdi.org/2009/03/16/go-fetch/

---

Fetch with Default Block
========================

Alternative
-----------

If you're the one creating the `Hash`, you can new it up with a different default:

~~~ ruby
h = Hash.new { :not_found }
h[:anything] # => :not_found
~~~

???

Note that `Array` does not have this feature (returning a default for an undefined element).

---

Tag Module
==========

A mix-in module whose sole purpose is to add a type to an object.

???

This one comes from Avdi Grimm's "Exceptional Ruby".

In Ruby, about the only place we idiomatically test for types is exception handling.

I'm open to other ideas for uses of type tagging though.

---

Tag Module
==========

~~~ ruby
module MyLib
  module Error; end

  def some_method
    do_something
  rescue StandardError => error
    error.extend(MyLib::Error)
    raise
  end
end
~~~

Now the caller can rescue on `MyLib::Error` or the original exception.

---

Page Object
===========

Use an object to represent a screen within your app

Methods represent actions you can perform on the screen

You can also ask questions about elements on the page

???

This one is mainly used for full-stack acceptance test.

Abstracts away the actions, so you don't have to specify details.

---

Page Object
===========

~~~ ruby
Given /^I have logged in$/ do
  @home_page = LoginPage.new.login(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
end

class LoginPage
  include Capybara::DSL

  def initialize
    visit "/login"
  end

  def login(user, password)
    fill_in :user, user
    fill_in :password password
    click 'login'
    HomePage.new(page)
  end
end
~~~

???

Makes cucumber steps more object-oriented instead of procedural.

Reduces the problem in Cucumber of having tons of global methods (in "worlds").

---

Test Spies
==========

I've had a long hatred of mocking

It doesn't fit the patterns:

  * Setup, Exercise, Verify, Teardown
  * Arrange, Act, Assert
  * Given, When, Then

???

My hatred of mocking might not be for the reason that you expect.

What I hate is that a mock makes an assertion in the arrange section.

---

Test Spies
==========

~~~ ruby
require "rspec"

RSpec.describe "An invitiation" do
  let(:invitation) { double("invitation", deliver: nil) }

  it "should be delivered" do
    expect(invitation).to receive(:deliver)
    invitation.deliver
  end
end
~~~

???

The expectation is in the "wrong" place.

This prevents reuse of the setup (`before` block in RSpec).

---

Test Spies
==========

~~~ ruby
RSpec.describe "An invitiation" do
  let(:invitation) { double("invitation", deliver: nil) }

  it "should be delivered" do
    invitation.deliver
    expect(invitation).to have_received(:deliver)
  end
end
~~~

???

Now we can exercise the code in a common `before` block if we want.
(Although exercise is more of a "during".)

And the assertion only runs in one place.

---

Allow Class or Instance
=======================

~~~ ruby
date1 = Date.new(2014, 11, 17)
date2 = Date.new(2014, 11, 17, Date::Calendar::Julian)
julian_1st = Date.new(Int64::MIN, Date::Calendar::Julian)
gregorian_1st = Date.new(1752, 9, 14, Date::Calendar::Gregorian)
default_calendar = Date::Calendar.new(julian_1st, gregorian_1st)
date3 = Date.new(2014, 11, 17, default_calendar)
~~~

???

This one I discovered when writing the Date class for the Crystal standard library.

For `date3`, we're passing an instance.
For `date2`, we're specifying the class.

I'm honestly not sure if this is a very good idiom or not.

But it seemed useful at least in the case of this API.

---

Allow Class or Instance
=======================

~~~ ruby
class Date
  def initialize(year, month, day, calendar = Date::Calendar.default)
    calendar = calendar.new if calendar.is_a?(Class)
    ...
  end
end
~~~

???

The code just news up an instance of the class if it's found to be a class.

In this case, the Julian and Gregorian claendars have different behavior,
so we need them to be separate classes.

Alternatively, we could make them constants that are instances of the class.
But then we'd have to give them singleton methods.

TODO: Show an example where we chose singleton methods?

---

Configuration Query
===================

Ask a question about the configuration

???

Really just a case of good abstraction and API design.
We take the "normal" config query up a level of abstraction.

---

Configuration Query
===================

~~~ ruby
ExtraLogging.for_applicant?(applicant_id)
~~~

---

Configuration Query
===================

~~~ ruby
class ExtraLogging
  def self.for_applicant?(applicant_id)
    applicant_ids.include?(applicant_id.to_s)
  end

  def self.applicant_ids
    @applicant_ids ||= config.fetch('applicant_ids'){[]}.map(&:to_s)
  end

  def self.config
    @config ||= YAML.load_file(CONFIG_FILENAME)
  end

  def self.reload
    @applicant_ids = nil
    @config = nil
  end
end
~~~

---

Module Factory
==============

First, a story of discovery

???

This is the idiom that instigated this presentation.

---

Module Factory
==============

~~~ ruby
class User
  include MyORM::Model
  table 'people'
end
~~~

Isn't `table` more like an option to the module being included?

---

Module Factory
==============

But this isn't valid Ruby:

~~~ ruby
class User
  include MyORM::Model, table: 'people'
end
~~~

---

Module Factory
==============

Then I saw Virtus do this:

~~~ ruby
class User
  include Virtus.model(constructor: false, mass_assignment: false)
end
~~~

---

Module Factory
==============

Uses the Factory Pattern to create a module

Configures the created module per the parameters we pass it

---

Module Factory
==============

~~~ ruby
module Virtus
  def self.model(options = {})
    Module.new.tap do |mod|
      if options.fetch(:constructor) { true }
        mod.send(:include, Model::Constructor)
      end
    end
  end
end
~~~

???

We're using several other Ruby idioms here:
  * Defining a class method
  * Modifying an object in-line with `tap`
  * Fetch with Default Value
  * Options Hash
  * Accessing a private method with `send`

We can do a lot of different things with configuration:
  * Take positional parameters
  * Take a block
  * Use the Builder Pattern

If we're going to call the factory more than a few times,
we'll probably want to memoize modules for reuse where possible.

---

Module Factory
==============

Other names for this:
  - Parameterized Module Inclusion

---

Circuit Breaker
===============

Stop trying to access an inaccessible resource.

* Slow or unresponsive network resource
* A queue has been filled up
* A thread pool or connection pool that's been exhausted

???

This one comes to us by way of Martin Fowler
(of "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture" fame)
and Michael Nygard (from "Release It!").

* Reduces resources tied up in operations which are likely to fail.
* Reduces cascading failures due to resource issues.

---

Circuit Breaker
===============

~~~ ruby
def do_something
  make_external_call unless circuit_broken?
rescue Timeout::Error
  break_circuit
  raise $!
end

def circuit_broken?
  @circuit_broken ||= false
end

def break_circuit
  @circuit_broken = true
end

def reset_circuit
  @circuit_broken = false
end
~~~

Would probably use an object and a block to implement.

???

https://github.com/wsargent/circuit_breaker/tree/master

---

Circuit Breaker
===============

Lots of additional options available:

* What to do when the circuit is broken
  * Drop the request
  * Raise an exception
  * Use a promise to return a result later
* Conditions for deciding when to flip the breaker
  * Thresholds
* Conditions to automatically reset the circuit
* Logging and alerting

---

Blue-Green Deployment
=====================

You have 2 complete production environments

One is live, the other is "previous" or "next"

Deploy to one while the other is still running

After smoke testing the deploy, swap the live with "next"

Very easy to switch back to "previous"

???

This is a deployment pattern.

I'd like to see more Rubyists adopt this, as they have Continuous Deployment.

The only tricky part is database integrity.

---

Conclusions
===========

Learn idioms -- they're great tools

Our idioms are not static

Be on the lookout for new idioms

???


I hope you'll think about using some of these.

The main take-away here is that we can invent or discover new idioms that fit with our existing idioms.
