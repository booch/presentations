- What is an Idiom?

First I want to talk briefly about what an idiom is.

The dictionary gives us 3 definitions of "idiom".
In programming, an idiom in some ways fits all 3 definitions,
but I think the 3rd is most important.

My definition of an idiom is "the way we normally would do things".

For example, idiomatic Ruby uses `each` instead of `for` or `while` loops.


- Idiom versus Pattern

Is there a difference? I don't know.

I'm in some ways going to treat them the same.

A pattern is just a template for a common solution to a common problem.

Patterns aren't just for design and architecture level issues.
For example, Kent Beck's "Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns"
talks about patterns at the method level.


- Common Ruby Idioms

When reading Ruby code, it's often clear whether we're looking at idiomatic Ruby,
or someone "writing Java in Ruby".

...


- Module Factory

The first idiom I want to talk about is the Module Factory.

I've gone through several names for this one:
  - Parameterized Module Inclusion

... talk about what we did before this pattern

... talk about how I was looking for it, then discovered it

...


- Tag Module

This one comes from Avdi Grimm.

Mainly used for Exceptions.

...


- Circuit Breaker

...


- Fetch with Default Block

This is a simple one.

Also comes from Avdi.

Basically, the idea is to default to using a block instead of a 2nd parameter.
This is a good habit, because ...









- Ruby Meta Idioms

The overlap between Rubyists and Agile practitioners is very high.
I asked Dave Thomas about this, and he says it's because many of the same people were involved.

People forget that it's "reduce, reuse, recycle" - in that order.
I'm not sure how to recycle code, though.


- Conclusion

The main take-away here is that was can invent or discover new idioms that fit with our existing idioms.
