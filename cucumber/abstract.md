Abstract
========

When you write a web application, you need some way to test that it's
working properly. It's also helpful to be able to know when you've
correctly completed a new feature.

In this presentation, we'll cover several Open Source tools that you
can use to test any web site. These tools include Selenium (to drive
a web browser), Capybara (simple front end to Selenium and others),
and Cucumber (to write tests in English). You might use these tools
for site monitoring, user acceptance testing, regression testing, or
test-driven design.

We'll cover using these tools with Ruby and Java, but you don't need
to be a programmer to understand the presentation. We've used these
tools successfully on several projects, and found that they can help
us write better applications. Probably the most exciting part is that
our customers and QA testers write the Cucumber acceptance tests for
us.
