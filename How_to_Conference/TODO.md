* Story about why I carry a Tervis with St. Louis designs
* Talk about Ho-Fun's story about making small talk
* Talk about how many of us are assholes
    * We're used to being right, and don't know how to be wrong
        * We don't know how, because we haven't had much practice
    * We have to be careful, and work on this aspect of ourselves as well
