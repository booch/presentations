How to Conference: A Guide for Introverts (and Everyone Else)
=================

Abstract
--------

A lot of us techies are introverts.
But that shouldn't stop us from getting the most out of the conferences we attend.
Conferences provide value in 2 main areas - the content and the networking opportunities.
In this session, you'll learn strategies, tactics, and tips for getting better at networking
and getting more from your conference experience.


Details
-------

This would definitely be a "wetware" type of talk.

I've already started outlining the talk, and had a few people review it (including the person that suggested the idea).

A few key points:

* Introverts face some challenges getting the most out of conferences
* With some practice, you can become more outgoing
* Some suggested ice-breakers to start conversations
* "Hacks" to get people to initiate conversations with you

Some example advice I plan to mention:

* Ask people what talks they're excited about (towards the beginning)
* Ask people what talks they really liked (towards the end)
* Ask people where they're from; follow up with some things you know about that place - or want to know
* Add to your badge (or somewhere else on your person) a short list of things you'd like to talk about
    * "Ask me about..."
    * "Tell me about..."
* Hang out with more outgoing friends and have them introduce you to people
    * Ask them to start conversations about topics they know you and the other people are interested in
* When you're introduced, try to repeat a person's name 3 times over the next 5 minutes
* Talk to speakers after their talks
    * Preferably not *right* after, though
* Don't miss out on the "hallway track"
* Wear something outrageous, so people will come talk to you
* Talk to people the least like you; you'll learn more from their different perspectives


Pitch
-----

After attending a conference earlier this year, a friend and colleague tweeted
"Organizers of future conferences, I really need a talk on how to get better at going to conferences.
I'm really bad at networking."

I thought that was a cool idea.
After thinking about the idea and discussing it with my wife,
she convinced me that I'd be uniquely qualified to give that talk.
I'm naturally an introvert, but I decide many years ago to work on be more outgoing.
I had just gone to 3 conferences in 5 weeks, and done a significantly better job at networking than I'd ever done before;
the work I'd done was starting to pay off.

I remember being told in college that networking is important, but didn't really understand what that meant.
I didn't understand how to do it, so I couldn't understand its importance.
I eventually started to understand its importance, but still wasn't very good at it.
I'm still figuring it out, but starting to get the hang of it.

I've given a few conference talks, but they were very technical.
And frankly rather dry, with more bullet points than I should use.
I've already started working on this talk, and it'll be all pictures, with a just few words on screen.
All the "content" will be delivered verbally.
(Although now I'm starting to reconsider that.
Some of those examples I gave above might be worth explicitly showing -- at least in a summary.
I'll get feedback on that from several reviewers.)

I've started finding additional sources for more tactics and tips.
For example, BethCodes' blog on impostor syndrome;
Susan Kane's book Quiet (The Power of Introverts) and her TED Talk;
and Alex Harms' blog articles (and the book she's working on) about empathy.
(Coraline Ada Ehmke and Ernie Miller are also working on a book about empathy and developers;
hopefully I'll get to see that in time to get some more ideas.)
