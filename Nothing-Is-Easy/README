# Nothing Is Easy

- See if I can get my "business cards" printed in time

## TODO

- Have ChatGPT help
    - Generate some ideas for engaging the audience
    - Generate some background images for the slides
        - Title page especially
    - Generate some ideas for the talk
        - Make up some "real-world" examples
- The reason `nil` causes so much trouble is that it has no single meaning
    - it can mean different things in different contexts
    - And in Ruby, loose typing means that pretty much **any** value you have could be `nil`
    - So we want to do everything we can to avoid the problems with `nil`
        - And that means understanding what `nil` means in each context
            - And replacing it with a more meaningful value in many places
        - Understand when we might have a `nil`
            - But be confident when we know that a value cannot be `nil` within a context
                - Otherwise, we'll end up with a ton of `nil` checks

### How to get the audience to engage

0. Hand out snacks?
1. Hook
    - Start with a story
    - Ask a question
    - Analogy or metaphor
    - Shocking statistic
2. Transition from the hook into the topic
3. Introduce myself
4. Preview/agenda
    - Remember that many people will be watching the video
5. Tell the audience what to expect to gain
