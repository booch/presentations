# Nothing Is Easy

- See if I can get my "business cards" printed in time

## TODO

- Empty arrays (or other Enumerable)
- More code examples
- Refactoring examples - before, after
- Replacing with an exception
- Replacing with a symbol?
- Type Safety
- Nil Parameters
- More Null Object examples
    - NullLineItems (from GPT)
    - NullLogger
- More on Special Case?
- More on root causes
    - In Ruby, loose typing means that pretty much **any** value you have could be `nil`
    - So we want to do everything we can to avoid the problems with `nil`
- Better background images
- Have ChatGPT help
    - Generate some ideas for engaging the audience
    - Generate some background images for the slides
        - Title page especially
    - Generate some ideas for the talk
        - Make up some "real-world" examples


### How to get the audience to engage

0. Hand out snacks?
1. Hook
    - Start with a story
    - Ask a question
    - Analogy or metaphor
    - Shocking statistic
2. Transition from the hook into the topic
3. Introduce myself
4. Preview/agenda
    - Remember that many people will be watching the video
5. Tell the audience what to expect to gain

### Before Conference
