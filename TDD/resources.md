TDD Resources
=============

It's highly recommended to create Rally tickets to track your team's progress learning TDD.

Presentations
-------------

A PowerPoint that I've given to teams introducing all the concepts involved in TDD: https://booch.github.io/presentations/TDD/Intro%20to%20TDD.pptx
(Be sure to look at the presenter notes.)

A PowerPoint from "Uncle" Bob Martin, showing all the steps using Java to do the bowling kata: http://butunclebob.com/files/downloads/Bowling%20Game%20Kata.ppt

A PowerPoint from a CS class: http://www.cs.du.edu/~snarayan/sada/teaching/COMP3705/lecture/p1/Test_Driven_Development_v5.ppt

Agile Alliance's info on TDD: https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd

A pretty good article on TDD: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/test-driven-development-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not-41fa6bca02a2/

Books
-----

The canonical book on TDD is Kent Beck's _Test-Driven Development By Example_. I'd recommend that all the team tech coaches have a copy. It's good to read through to fill any gaps you might have, and also to use as a reference.

Another good book is _Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests_. It walks you through using TDD to improve your OOP designs.

Katas
-----

I would encourage every developer to try to work through at least 1 TDD kata on their own, with a pair partner, or as a group. TDD is a skill that requires practice. Ideally, each person would work through multiple katas.

* https://github.com/boochtek/bowling-tdd-kata-javascript
* https://kata-log.rocks/tdd

Really, any kata will do, if it doesn't already have tests (or you delete the existing tests before you start). Some good sites with lots of katas:

* https://exercism.org/
* https://codingdojo.org/kata/
* https://github.com/gamontal/awesome-katas
* http://codekata.com/


Feel free to reach out to me via WebEx or email with any questions you might have about TDD or related topics, or if you're looking for more resources.
