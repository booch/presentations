class: middle, center

I wrote an ORM

???

* I started writing a Ruby ORM last year

---
class: middle, center

I wrote an ORM in 350 lines

???

* It's surprisingly small
* I suppose you could call it a micro-ORM
    * Missing some features that most ORMs have
        * Mostly by design
    * But has some features that other micro-ORMs don't


* Was under 200 lines before I refactored to clean things up
    * It had less features, and the code was a mess
    * It supported has_many relationships in those 200 lines

---

ORM
===

* Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)


* Connects your app to your database


* Ruby - objects
* SQL - relations

???

* I want to make sure everyone knows what an ORM is
* SQL databases deal with relations
  * Relational algebra
* Ruby deals with objects
* ORM brings those 2 sides together
* Caveat: there's an "impedance mismatch" between the 2 sides
    * What works well on one side might not work well on the other
    * Some data structures can't be mapped 1-to-1
    * Example: tree structure
        * Easy to do in OOP
        * Several ways to represent in relational algebra

---

Why?
====

* I'm not happy with any Ruby ORM

???

* Why would I tackle such a daunting task?
* First, I'm not really happy with any existing Ruby ORM

---

Why?
====

* To explore and learn

???

* I've been interested in writing an ORM for a while
* My colleague Amos King (@adkron) often tells people to write their own ORM
* Maybe I can learn enough to write my ideal ORM someday
    * They say to write something good, "write one to throw away"
        * Make mistakes, learn from them
        * Have a better architecture / design the 2nd try

---

Why?
====

Trying to answer:

* How simple can we make an ORM?
* What is the **essence** of an ORM?

???

* ORMs are really complex
    * But do they have to be?
* How simple can we make an ORM?
* What is the **essence** of an ORM?

---

Why?
====

Trying to answer:

* Why do we try so hard to hide SQL?
    * Is the added complexity worth it?
* Why don't we just use SQL?
    * We have to know SQL anyway
    * All ORMs are very leaky abstractions

???

* Every ORM I've used has a DSL to help write SQL
    * DSL = domain specific language
    * But then you usually end up having to write some SQL
    * This is a leaky abstraction
    * Leaky abstraction = it doesn't always work
    * Leaky abstraction = sometimes you have to go down a level of abstraction
* What if we made the leaky abstraction leak all the way?

---

Opinion
=======

* Data Mapper pattern is better than the Active Record pattern

???

* I also started designing the ORM based on a few strong opinions

---

Opinion
=======

* Regular attributes and relational attributes need to be declared in one place

???

* The thing that drives me most crazy about ActiveRecord is having to look in 2 places for things
    * Relationships (or associations) are defined in the model
        * `has_many`
        * `belongs_to`
    * Attributes are defined in the DB schema

---

Opinion
=======

* NoSQL as a main data store is usually misguided

???

* I don't believe that most uses of NoSQL are legitimate
    * I don't think most of us know SQL well enough to know when to abandon it
* PostgreSQL can do just about anything you need
    * Including most of what NoSQL does
    * But it still uses SQL
* Sarah Mei has an excellent article on why to never use MongoDB
    * You'll paint yourself into a corner a year later
* I spoke w/ someone at Stripe about this
    * MongoDB is their primary DB
    * They copy everything out of it to PostgreSQL for ad-hoc queries

---

Opinion
=======

* Abstracting to allow switching RDBMSes? YAGNI!

???

* How many of you have every switched database vendors?
    * Was it as easy as just changing your `database.yml` file?
* YAGNI = You Ain't Gonna Need It
* Developer workstations are fast enough to run a "full" RDBMS
    * RDBMS = Relational DataBase Management System
* It makes sense to do all your development on the same DB as production
    * If you can
    * Postgres and MySQL are definitely feasible
    * Oracle and SQL Server may not be feasible
        * But "Express" versions will probably work in most cases
* Even if you do change DBs, it's never easy
    * Unless your app is simple and uninteresting
        * In that case, why would you need to change RDBMSes?
* Don't half-way prepare for something that will probably never happen

---

ActiveRecord
============

* Ubiquitous
    * Everyone knows it
    * Lots of people improving it
    * Plugins usually assume you're using it
    * Documentation
* Well-tested
* Well-understood
* Easy to use - it comes with Rails

???

* Who loves ActiveRecord?
* Who hates ActiveRecord?
* Who raised their hand both times?
* I'm mostly in the hate camp
* Who has had to manually type SQL in an ActiveRecord class?
    * So ActiveRecord is a leaky abstraction
        * SQL leaked up into the upper layers of abstraction
* ActiveRecord is the 800-pount gorilla
    * Every Rubyist knows it
    * It's well-tested
    * Frankly, it's just easy to start using it
        * You don't need to even think
* Odds are, if you're hired to work on Rails, you'll be using AR

---

Active Record Pattern
=====================

* Domain logic and persistence logic in same class


* ActiveRecord ORM uses this pattern

???

* Domain logic = logic about the "things" in our application
    * And the interactions between those things
* ActiveRecord (the ORM) is based on the Active Record pattern
    * "Active Record" (with a space) = the pattern
    * "ActiveRecord" (no space) = the ORM
* Active Record pattern described by Martin Fowler
    * [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture][peap]
    * Discusses the trade-offs
* A lot of terminology also comes from:
    * [Domain-Driven Design][ddd] by Eric Evans

---
class: diagram

Active Record Pattern
=====================

![UML diagram of Active Record Pattern](active_record.uml.png)

???

* Here's the UML diagram for the Active Record pattern
* Things to note here:
    * `find` is a class method
    * The object knows how to save itself
    * The model is dependent on the DB

---

Active Record Pattern
=====================

* Violates SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)


* Does 2 things:
    * Domain model
    * Persistence

???

* Who didn't "get" MVC before they used Rails?
    * Rails provided a big "a-ha" moment for most of us
* MVC is about separation of concerns
    * Models contain domain logic
    * Controllers handle web request/response
    * Views handle output
* Separation of concerns:
    * Is important
    * Is closely related to Single Responsibility Principle
* My biggest problem with AR is that it encourages bad engineering habits
    * Mostly SRP violation
    * Makes it harder to test domain logic without testing
* My experience - the sweet spot for ActiveRecord:
    * About 20 or fewer model classes
    * A fully CRUD app

---

Active Record Pattern
=====================

* Violates SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)


* Does 2 things:
    * Domain model
    * Persistence

???

* But most apps are more sophisticated than just CRUD

---

Data Mapper Pattern
===================

* Maps between domain objects and the database
* Domain objects don't have to know anything about the database or its schema
* DB schema and model object structure can differ
    * DB schema can change without having to change domain objects
        * Only the mapper changes

???

* There was a Ruby ORM called DataMapper
    * It didn't quite implement the Data Mapper pattern
    * It was closer to the Active Record pattern
* Martin Fowler explicitly says (in PEAP):
    * Active Record is a starting point
    * Should move to Data Mapper once you get more complex
* You might see domain model objects called "entities"
    * Entity = the object is defined by its ID
    * From [Domain-Driven Design][ddd] by Eric Evans
* Python's SQL Alchemy uses the Data Mapper pattern
    * This library is very highly regarded
    * Basically *the* Python ORM

---
class: diagram

Data Mapper Pattern
===================

![UML diagram of Data Mapper Pattern](data_mapper.uml.png)

???

* This is **not quite** the UML diagram for the Data Mapper pattern
    * It actually conflates Data Mapper and Repository patterns
* Things to note here:
    * The User class knows nothing about the database
    * The repo class knows how to find and save User objects

---

Repository Pattern
==================

* Represents a collection of domain objects

???

* The Repository pattern represents a collection of domain objects
    * Can treat the database as an in-memory collection
* We have something similar in ActiveRecord:
    * Class methods
    * Scopes
* But AR doesn't support 2 different data stores for the same model class
* Class methods are generally problematic
    * Leads to procedural code instead of OO code
    * Often indicates that you've missed an abstraction
    * Limits polymorphism
    * Hard to test
    * Hard to refactor
        * See [this Code Climate article][code-climate-class-methods] for details

---

Repository Architecture
=======================

* Domain model class handles business logic
* Repository class handles persistence
* Mapper class handles mapping database fields to object attributes

???

* Repository pattern gives a clear separation of concerns

---

Ruby Preserves
==============

![jar of preserves with a ruby on the label](ruby_preserves.png)

???

* I started Ruby Preserves by writing the README
    * Or maybe by coming up with a clever name
* README-driven development
    * Before writing **any** code
    * I put all those things in the README
        * Motivations
        * Opinions
        * How I wanted the ORM to be used (the API)

---

Domain Model
============

* Can use a Struct, an OStruct, a Virtus model, or a PORO class


~~~ ruby
User = Struct.new(:id, :name, :age, :addresses)

craig = User.new("booch", "Craig", 44, [])
~~~

???

* Here's what that API looks like
* Start with the domain model
* We can just use a plain old Ruby object (PORO)
* Here we're using a Struct
* Note that I can create my model with no database involved
    * How much of our app can we write without any persistence?
        * Probably much more than you think
* This is a lot simpler than an ActiveRecord model, right?
    * But it also shows all the field names in one place

---

Repository
==========

~~~ ruby
require "preserves"

Preserves.data_store = Preserves.PostgreSQL("rubyconf_example")

UserRepository = Preserves.repository(model: User) do
end
~~~

???

* When we get to the point of needing persistence:
    * Configure Ruby Preserves with the name of the DB
    * Define a repository associated with the model class
* As James Edward Gray pointed out:
    * I need to get rid of requiring the `model` keyword for the argument

---

Relationships
=============

* Has Many
* Belongs To
* Has and Belongs to Many
* Has Many Through

???

* Relationships aren't usually implemented in micro-ORMs
* I've implemented has_many and belongs_to
    * They took less than 2 hours each
        * But it took months to think about how to do it

---

Data Mapping
============

~~~ ruby
UserRepository = Preserves.repository(model: User) do
  mapping do
    primary_key 'username'
    map id: 'username'
    map :age, Integer
    has_many :addresses,
             repository: AddressRepository,
             foreign_key: 'username'
    belongs_to :group, repository: GroupRepository
  end
end
~~~

???

* The next thing we need to do is:
    * Define mapping between domain model and database table
* Don't need to define table name, because hand-writing all SQL
* Define the primary key
    * So every repo gets a `fetch` method for free
    * Fetch method takes the ID (or primary key)
        * Returns the object associated with that ID
* Database field named `username`
    * Corresponds to `id` attribute in model
* `age` field
    * Has the same name in DB and model
    * Specify it as an Integer
    * Specifying the type lets us serialize/coerce the data
        * As it goes between the DB and the model
        * Coercing between user input and the model is out of scope for the mapper
* Collection of `addresses`
    * This is a `has_many` relationship
    * In DB, addresses are stored in a separate table
       * Addresses in that table reference the user table
           * With foreign key named `username`
       * Use the `AddressRepository` to new up each address
* We also have a `group` object, that have to get from another table
    * This is a `belongs_to` relationship
    * `GroupRepository` will be used to new up that object

---

Repository Methods
==================

~~~ ruby
UserRepository = Preserves.repository(model: User) do
  def insert(user)
    result = query("INSERT INTO 'users' (username, name, age) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)",
                   user.id, user.name, user.age)
    raise "Could not insert User #{user.id} into database" unless result.rows == 1
  end

  def older_than(age)
    SQL = "SELECT *, username AS id FROM 'users' WHERE age > $1 ORDER BY $2"
    select(SQL, age, :name)
  end

  def with_id(id)
    SQL = "SELECT *, username AS id FROM 'users' WHERE username = $1"
    select(SQL, id)
  end
end
~~~

???

* Note we're creating singletons for repositories
    * Changing that to a class is on my TODO list

---

N+1 Queries
===========

* Main query gets an object that includes a collection
* Iterating through the collection
    * Generates a separate query for each item in the collection


* If using ActiveRecord: use Bullet

???

* N+1 Queries are an anti-pattern
    * SQL queries involve network latency, so are slow
* If you've got a post with 1000 comments:
    * You'll have 1 SQL query for the post
    * You'll have 1000 queries, 1 to get each comment
* ActiveRecord will sometimes give you N+1 queries
* Usually, this is because you're manually iterating through a collection
    * Solution is often to use `include` to eagerly load the collection
* Bullet is a Rails plugin that watches for N+1 queries in DEV

---

Relationships - Has Many
========================

~~~ ruby
AddressRepository = Preserves.repository(model: Address) do
  mapping { map :city, String }
end

UserRepository = Preserves.repository(model: User) do
  mapping do
    primary_key 'username'
    map id: 'username'
    has_many :addresses, repository: AddressRepository,
                         foreign_key: 'user_id'
  end

  def all
    addresses = query("SELECT * FROM addresses")
    repository.select("SELECT * FROM users", addresses: addresses)
  end
end
~~~

???

* Note that we have only 2 very simple queries there
* We'd probably want to have a `WHERE` clause on the `addresses` query
    * So we only get the addresses associated with the users we got

---

Relationships - Belongs To
==========================

~~~ ruby
GroupRepository = Preserves.repository(model: Group) do
  mapping { map :name, String }
end

UserRepository = Preserves.repository(model: User) do
  mapping do
    primary_key 'username'
    map id: 'username'
    belongs_to :group, repository: GroupRepository
  end

  def all
    groups = query("SELECT * FROM groups")
    repository.select("SELECT * FROM users", groups: groups)
  end
end
~~~

???

* Again, we have only 2 very simple queries
* We don't support has_many and belongs_to for the same set of repos
    * It's generally recommended not to do this
        * Due to circular dependencies

---

Wrong Turns
===========

* I made several mistakes building Ruby Preserves
* Tried creating proxy objects for every relationship
    * So relationships weren't queried until they were used
* Was generating SQL in the Ruby Preserves code
* Led to N+1 queries

???

* I made a few mistakes along the way
    * Not so sure there aren't some remaining big mistakes
* Biggest mistake was generating SQL
    * Violated whole principle of using raw SQL
    * Complex code
    * Generated terrible SQL
    * Created N+1 queries
* Proxy object sound great at first
    * Don't populate the relationships unless they're used
    * But if we know we're going to need something, we should get it
* Learning experiences
* It took me a long time to think about how to do relationships
    * I took several wrong turns before I came up with something reasonable
    * Even when I was headed in the right direction, it took time to narrow in
    * Once I narrow in, the implementation was quick
        * This is how I knew I had found the right abstraction
    * I'm pretty happy with what I eventually came up with

---

Relationships - JOINs
=====================

* JOINs happen in Ruby, not SQL

???

* Maybe
* The one part that I'm not 100% comfortable with
* It's best if we could do JOINs in SQL
* I think it's OK though
    * Web app usage patterns usually save us
        * A web app will never want to show 1000s of things on screen
        * All SQL queries in real apps should have LIMIT clauses

---

Relationships - JOINs
=====================

~~~ sql
SELECT * FROM users;
┌──────────┬──────┬─────┬──────────┐
│ username │ name │ age │ group_id │
└──────────┴──────┴─────┴──────────┘

SELECT * FROM groups;
┌────┬──────┐
│ id │ name │
└────┴──────┘

SELECT groups.*, users.* FROM groups JOIN users
ON users.group_id = groups.id;
┌────┬──────┬──────────┬──────┬─────┬──────────┐
│ id │ name │ username │ name │ age │ group_id │
└────┴──────┴──────────┴──────┴─────┴──────────┘
~~~

???

* Here's where the problem comes in
    * We've got a JOIN of 2 tables with the same column name
    * The result has 2 columns named `name`
* Unfortunately, SQL doesn't really have a good simple solution for this

---

Relationships - JOINs
=====================

~~~ sql
SELECT g.id AS g__id, g.name AS g__name,
       u.username AS u__username, u.name AS u__username,
       u.age AS u__age
FROM groups AS g
JOIN users AS u ON u.group_id = g.id;
┌───────┬─────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬────────┐
│ g__id │ g__name │ u__username │ u__username │ u__age │
└───────┴─────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴────────┘
~~~

???

* This is how most ORMs solve this
    * Specifying every column
        * With a mapping in the SQL
        * And then another mapping in the Ruby code
* I didn't want to force that complexity on my API users
    * It would have changed the whole concept

---

Advantages
==========

* Domain class contains everything you need to know
    * Don't have to look elsewhere to understand everything a class contains
* Better meets the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* Small, easy to understand
    * Currently about 350 lines of code
* Encourages better separation of concerns
* Encourages better understanding of SQL
* Experimentation / learning

???

* And 100 of those 350 lines are just `end`
* For comparison:
    * ActiveRecord is 210 kloc
        * Stats from Sean Griffin, [Ruby Rogues episode 222][rr-222]
    * Sequel is 31 kloc
    * Lotus::Model is 2 kloc (plus it uses Sequel)
    * Perpetuity is 2.5 kloc (with all 3 adapters)
* I used David A. Wheeler's `sloccount` to get lines of code

---

Disadvantages
=============

* No composability
    * `published.by_author("craig")`
* Tied to a single RDBMS
    * No in-memory DB option
* API is slightly less convenient
    * No `user.save`
    * No `user.persisted?`
* No ActiveModel

???

* Composability is the biggest disadvantage
    * So we can't chain scopes like ActiveRecord does:
        * We have no equivalent to `published.by_author("craig")`
* We could easily add adapters to support multiple DBs
    * But you might have to change your SQL
* Even if we had an in-memory option, you'd need 2 separate repos
    * One repo with the SQL for PostgreSQL
    * Another repo that does whatever the in-memory storage needed

---

Further Work
============

* Optimizations / caching
    * Prepared statements
* ActiveModel compatibility
* Automatically determine mappings, where possible
    * Virtus model attribute definitions
    * Database schema
* How does this compare with the DAO pattern?
* Add a layer to write the SQL for us?
* Could this be used in production code?

???

* Mostly a proof of concept at this point
    * Haven't done any optimizations
        * Haven't done any performance testing
* Prepared statements = caching SQL query plan on the DB server
    * Optimizes queries that runs frequently
* Implementing ActiveModel would probably be possible
    * Wouldn't be able to use POROs any more though
    * Biggest challenge - have to implement `persisted?` predicate
        * Predicate method = returns a true/false value
            * By convention ends in `?` in Ruby
            * Actually can be truthy/falsey in Ruby
        * Requires a circular dependency
            * Model class would have to depend on the Repository
                * To answer if a particular model object has been persisted
                * But the Repository already depends on the model class
* I'd like to automatically determine mappings, if we can
    * Could pull them from the DB
        * Remember, the Repository already knows about the DB
    * Could pull them from the model
        * Virtus has a nice API for defining attributes
            * Repository could ask the model what those attributes are
* DAO = Data Access Object
    * Research for this presentation, found a lot of similarities
* Layer on top of this to write the SQL for us?
    * Would give nice separation of concerns **within** the ORM
        * Separate SQL generation from object-relational mapping
* I'd like to see if I can get this to the point to be used in production code

Alternatives
============

1. Lotus::Model
2. Perpetuity
3. ROM
4. Sequel
5. ActiveRecord with declared attributes

???

* Ruby Preserves is nowhere near ready for production
* I still don't have an ORM I'm really happy with
* This is the order I'd currently consider them, for my personal projects
    * Obviously, context matters a lot
* Lotus::Model
    * Pretty young and immature (0.5)
    * Implements Data Mapper pattern
    * Can use POROs
        * Just need to define 3 simple methods
    * Defines "scopes" similar to how Ruby Preserves does it
        * All built-in scopes (`where`, `order`, `limit`) are private
    * Repository adapters/strategies for:
        * SQL
        * In-memory
        * Flat files
    * Main problem I have with it:
        * All mapping are done in a single config section
            * I'd rather mappings be in the Repository classes
    * Other problems:
        * Scopes are class methods
* Perpetuity
    * Jamie Gaskins
    * Small
    * No support for relationships - yet
    * Used in a few production apps
* ROM - Ruby Object Mapper
    * Piotr Solnica (primarily)
    * Goes further than Data Mapper pattern
    * Command-Query Separation
    * Immutability in many places
    * A couple problems I have:
        * Requires a **very** different mindset
        * Built bottom-up, less attention to public API
* Sequel
    * Jeremy Evans
        * Won a Ruby Hero award earlier this year
        * Also wrote the Excellent
    * Excellent ORM
    * Found it when researching a talk on Alternatives to ActiveRecord
    * It's exactly what I'm looking for
        * Except it implements the Active Record pattern
        * I want the Sequel of the Data Mapper pattern
* ActiveRecord added attribute declarations in version 4.2
    * Only popularized in 5.0
    * There were plugins available before that
        * Annotate Models and its descendants
            * Adds comments to the model file, with fields listed
        * My own Virtus::ActiveRecord
