# Ruby Preserves

![jar of preserves with a ruby on the label](ruby_preserves.png)

---
class: middle, center

I wrote an ORM

???

* I started writing a Ruby ORM last year

---
class: middle, center

I wrote an ORM in 350 lines

???

* I suppose I should call it a micro-ORM
    * Because it's so small
* Was under 200 lines before I refactored to clean things up
    * It had less features, and the code was a mess
    * It supported has_many relationships in those 200 lines

---

ORM
===

* Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)


* Connects your app to your database


* Ruby - objects
* SQL - relations

???

* First, I want to make sure everyone knows what an ORM is
* SQL databases deal with relations
  * Relational algebra
* Ruby deals with objects
* Caveat: there's an "impedance mismatch" between the 2 sides

---

Why?
====

* I'm not happy with any ORM

???

* I don't think the Active Record pattern is usually the right choice
* I'm still looking for the ideal ORM implementing the Data Mapper pattern
    * Sequel is the ideal ORM implementing the Active Record pattern

---

Why?
====

* To explore and learn

???

* I've been interested in writing an ORM for a while
* My colleague Amos King (@adkron) often tells people to write their own ORM
* Maybe I can learn enough to write the ideal Data Mapper ORM
    * Preserves is the "one to throw away"

---

Why?
====

* See how simple can we make an ORM that is still useful

---

Why?
====

Trying to answer:

* Why do we try so hard to hide SQL?
    * Is the added complexity worth it?
* Why don't we just use SQL?
    * We have to know SQL anyway
    * All ORMs are very leaky abstractions

???

* ActiveRecord is pretty complex
    * Is the complexity really better than the complexity of SQL?
* A typical ORM uses an internal DSL to generate external DSL code
* Leaky abstraction = sometimes have to use the things underneath the abstraction
* What if we made the leaky abstraction leak all the way?

---

Opinion
=======

* Data Mapper pattern is better than the Active Record pattern

???

* I also started designing the ORM based on a few strong opinions
* ActiveRecord is fine if you're just writing a CRUD front-end, with little interesting behavior

---

Opinion
=======

* Regular attributes and relational attributes need to be declared in one place

???

* The thing that drives me most crazy about ActiveRecord is having to look in 2 places for things
    * Relationships are defined in the model
    * Attributes are defined in the DB schema

---

Opinion
=======

* NoSQL as a main data store is usually misguided

???

* PostgreSQL can do just about anything you need, including what NoSQL does, using SQL
* See Sarah Mei's article on why to never use MongoDB
* I spoke w/ someone at Stripe, where MongoDB is their primary DB
    * They copy everything out of it to PostgreSQL for ad-hoc queries

---

Opinion
=======

* Abstracting to allow switching RDBMSes is YAGNI

???

* RDBMS = Relational DataBase Management System
* Developer workstations are fast enough to run "full" RDBMSes
* It makes sense to do all your development on the same DB as production, if you can
    * Postgres and MySQL are definitely feasible
    * Oracle and SQL Server may not be feasible, but now have "Express" versions
* If you're not using "interesting" features, then you're probably using "standard" SQL
* YAGNI = You Ain't Gonna Need It

---

ActiveRecord
============

* Ubiquitous
    * Everyone knows it
    * Lots of people improving it
    * Plugins usually assume you're using it
    * Documentation
* Well-tested
* Well-understood
* Easy to use - it comes with Rails

???

* Who loves ActiveRecord?
* Who hates ActiveRecord?
    * I hate ActiveRecord - mostly
* Who raised their hand both times?
* Who has had to manually type SQL in an ActiveRecord class?
    * So ActiveRecord is a leaky abstraction
        * SQL leaked up into the upper layers of abstraction
* ActiveRecord is the 800-pount gorilla
* Odds are, if you're hired to work on Rails, you'll be using AR

---

Active Record Pattern
=====================

* Domain logic and persistence logic in same class
* Violates SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)


* ActiveRecord ORM uses this pattern

???

* The biggest problem with AR is that it encourages bad engineering habits
    * This is mostly because it violates the SRP
* Note "Active Record" is the pattern and "ActiveRecord" is the ORM
* Active Record pattern described by Martin Fowler
    * [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture][peap]
    * Discusses the trade-offs involved with the coupling
* Separation of concerns in important
    * Just like Rails separates M-V-C concerns
    * But ActiveRecord does a terrible job at it
* My experience is that the sweet spot for AR is about 20 model classes
    * Data Mapper pattern has a little more overhead in the number of classes/concepts
        * Pays off a lot as you have more classes
        * Still has a couple advantages with only a few classes

---
class: diagram

Active Record Pattern
=====================

![UML diagram of Active Record Pattern](active_record.uml.png)

???

* Things to note here:
    * `find` is a class method
    * The object knows how to save itself

---

Data Mapper Pattern
===================

* Maps between domain objects and the database
* Domain objects don't have to know anything about the database or its schema
* DB schema and model object structure can differ
    * DB schema can change without having to change domain objects
        * Only the mapper changes

???

* Note that the DataMapper Ruby gem didn't actually use the Data Mapper pattern
    * It used the Active Record pattern
* Python's SQL Alchemy uses the Data Mapper pattern
    * This library is very highly regarded
    * Basically *the* Python ORM

---
class: diagram

Data Mapper Pattern
===================

![UML diagram of Data Mapper Pattern](data_mapper.uml.png)

???

* Things to note here:
    * The User class knows nothing about the database
    * The repo class knows how to find and save User objects

---

Repository Pattern
==================

* Represents a collection of domain objects

???

* In ActiveRecord, the class methods often act as the repository
    * But you can't easily have 2 repositories for the same model class with different data stores
    * Class methods are generally problematic
        * Leads to procedural code instead of OO code
        * Often indicates that you've missed an abstraction
        * Limits polymorphism
        * Hard to test
        * Hard to refactor
            * See [this Code Climate article][code-climate-class-methods] for details

---

Repository Architecture
=======================

* Domain model class handles business logic
* Repository class handles persistence
* Mapper class handles mapping database fields to object attributes

???

* We have a clear separation of concerns
* Sometimes we'll call the domain models entities
    * From [Domain-Driven Design][ddd] book
    * Entities implies that the object is defined by its ID

---

Domain Model
============

* Can use a Struct, an OStruct, a Virtus model, or a PORO class


~~~ ruby
User = Struct.new(:id, :name, :age, :addresses)

craig = User.new("booch", "Craig", 44, [])
~~~

???

* PORO = plain old Ruby object
* Here we're using a Struct
* Note that I can create my model with no database involved

---

Data Mapping
============

~~~ ruby
UserRepository = Preserves.repository(model: User) do
  mapping do
    # The database field named 'username' corresponds to the 'id' attribute in the model.
    map id: 'username'
    # The 'age' field should be mapped to an Integer in the model.
    map :age, Integer
    # The user has a collection of Address objects.
    has_many :addresses, repository: AddressRepository, foreign_key: 'username'
  end
end
~~~

---

Repository Methods
==================

~~~ ruby
UserRepository = Preserves.repository(model: User) do
  def insert(user)
    result = query("INSERT INTO 'users' (username, name, age) VALUES ($1, $2, $3)",
                   user.id, user.name, user.age)
    raise "Could not insert User #{user.id} into database" unless result.rows == 1
  end

  def older_than(age)
    SQL = "SELECT *, username AS id FROM 'users' WHERE age > $1 ORDER BY $2"
    select(SQL, age, :name)
  end

  def with_id(id)
    SQL = "SELECT *, username AS id FROM 'users' WHERE username = $1"
    select(SQL, id)
  end
end
~~~

???

* Note that we're still creating singletons for repositories
    * Changing that to a class is on my TODO list

---

Relationships
=============

* Has Many
* Belongs To
* Has and Belongs to Many
* Has Many Through

???

* Relationships aren't usually implemented in micro-ORMs
* I've implemented has_many and belongs_to
    * They took less than 2 hours each
        * But it took months to think about how to do it

---

N+1 Queries
===========

* Main query gets a collection
* You then iterate through the collection
    * Running another query for each item in the collection

???

* The 1 is the main query
* The N is all the queries for all the items in the collection
* This is an anti-pattern, of course
    * Because if you have 1000 items, you have 1001 SQL queries
    * SQL queries involve network latency, so are slow
* ActiveRecord will sometimes give you N+1 queries
* Usually, this is because you're manually iterating through a collection
* Use a tool like Bullet in Rails to watch for N+1 queries

---

Relationships - Has Many
========================

~~~ ruby
AddressRepository = Preserves.repository(model: Address) do
  mapping { map :city, String }
end

UserRepository = Preserves.repository(model: User) do
  mapping do
    primary_key 'username'
    map id: 'username'
    has_many :addresses, repository: AddressRepository,
                         foreign_key: 'user_id'
  end

  def all
    addresses = query("SELECT * FROM addresses")
    repository.select("SELECT * FROM users", addresses: addresses)
  end
end
~~~

???

* Note that we have only 2 very simple queries there
* We'd probably want to have a `WHERE` clause on the `addresses` query
    * So we only get the addresses associated with the users we got

---

Relationships - Belongs To
==========================

~~~ ruby
GroupRepository = Preserves.repository(model: Group) do
  mapping { map :name, String }
end

UserRepository = Preserves.repository(model: User) do
  mapping do
    primary_key 'username'
    map id: 'username'
    belongs_to :group, repository: GroupRepository
  end

  def all
    groups = query("SELECT * FROM groups")
    repository.select("SELECT * FROM users", groups: groups)
  end
end
~~~

???

* Again, we have only 2 very simple queries
* We don't support has_many and belongs_to for the same set of repos
    * It's generally recommended not to do this
        * Due to circular dependencies

---

Relationships - JOINs
=====================

* JOINs happen in Ruby, not SQL

???

* This is one part that I'm not 100% comfortable with
* It's best if we could do JOINs in SQL
* But I'm not terribly concerned about this
    * CRUD app usage patterns usually save us
        * A CRUD app will never want to show 1000s of things on screen
        * All SQL queries in real apps should have LIMIT clauses

---

Relationships - JOINs
=====================

~~~ sql
SELECT * FROM users;
┌──────────┬──────┬─────┬──────────┐
│ username │ name │ age │ group_id │
└──────────┴──────┴─────┴──────────┘

SELECT * FROM groups;
┌────┬──────┐
│ id │ name │
└────┴──────┘

SELECT groups.*, users.* FROM groups JOIN users
ON users.group_id = groups.id;
┌────┬──────┬──────────┬──────┬─────┬──────────┐
│ id │ name │ username │ name │ age │ group_id │
└────┴──────┴──────────┴──────┴─────┴──────────┘
~~~

???

* Here's where the problem comes in
    * The result has 2 columns named `name`
* Unfortunately, SQL doesn't really have a good simple solution for this

---

Relationships - JOINs
=====================

~~~ sql
SELECT g.id AS g__id, g.name AS g__name,
       u.username AS u__username, u.name AS u__username,
       u.age AS u__age
FROM groups AS g
JOIN users AS u ON u.group_id = g.id;
┌───────┬─────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┬────────┐
│ g__id │ g__name │ u__username │ u__username │ u__age │
└───────┴─────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┴────────┘
~~~

???

* This is how most ORMs solve this
    * Specifying every column
        * With a mapping in the SQL
        * And then another mapping in the Ruby code
* I didn't want to force that complexity on my API users
    * It would have changed the whole concept

---

Wrong Turns
===========

* I made a mistake trying to make relationships work in Ruby Preserves
* Tried creating proxy objects for every relationship
    * So relationships weren't queried until they were used
* Was generating SQL in the Ruby Preserves code
* Led to N+1 queries

???

* This was a wrong direction on many fronts
    * It violated the whole principle of using raw SQL
    * It was complex code
    * It generated terrible SQL
* The core idea was fine
    * Don't populate the relationships unless they're used
* But it was a learning experience
* It took me a long time to think about how to do relationships
    * I took several wrong turns before I came up with something reasonable
    * Even when I was headed in the right direction, it took time to narrow in
    * I'm pretty happy with what I eventually came up with

---

Advantages
==========

* Domain class contains everything you need to know
    * Don't have to look elsewhere to understand everything a class contains
* Better meets the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* Small, easy to understand
    * Currently about 350 lines of code
* Encourages better separation of concerns
* Encourages better understanding of SQL
* Experimentation / learning

???

* And 100 of those 350 lines are just `end`
* For comparison:
    * ActiveRecord is 210 kloc
        * Stats from Sean Griffin, [Ruby Rogues episode 222][rr-222]
    * Sequel is 31 kloc
    * Lotus::Model is 2 kloc (plus it uses Sequel)
    * Perpetuity is 2.5 kloc (with all 3 adapters)
* I used David A. Wheeler's `sloccount` to get lines of code

---

Disadvantages
=============

* No composability
    * `published.by_author("craig")`
* Tied to a single RDBMS
    * No in-memory DB option
* API is slightly less convenient
    * No `user.save`
    * No `user.persisted?`
* No ActiveModel

???

* Composability is the biggest disadvantage
    * So we can't chain scopes like ActiveRecord does:
        * We have no equivalent to `published.by_author("craig")`
* We could easily add adapters to support multiple DBs
    * But you might have to change your SQL
* Even if we had an in-memory option, you'd need 2 separate repos
    * One repo with the SQL for PostgreSQL
    * Another repo that does whatever the in-memory storage needed

---

Further Work
============

* Optimizations / caching
    * Prepared statements
* ActiveModel compatibility
* Automatically determine mappings, where possible
    * Virtus model attribute definitions
    * Database schema
* How does this compare with the DAO pattern?
* Could this be used in production code?
* Add a layer to write the SQL for us?

???

* Implementing ActiveModel would probably be possible
    * Wouldn't be able to use POROs any more though
    * Implementing `user.save` would require a circular dependency
        * The model's `save` call would have to call the repo
        * The repo depends on the model class
* DAO = Data Access Object

---

Alternatives
============

1. Lotus::Model
2. Perpetuity
3. ROM
4. Sequel
5. ActiveRecord with declared attributes

???

* Ruby Preserves is nowhere near ready for production
* I still don't have an ORM I'm really happy with
* This is the order I'd currently consider them, for my personal projects
    * Obviously, context matters a lot
* ActiveRecord added attribute declarations in version 4.2
    * Only popularized in 5.0
    * There were plugins available before that
        * Annotate Models and its descendants
        * My own Virtus::ActiveRecord
