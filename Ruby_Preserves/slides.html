* Agile practitioner

* Boring slide designer
* Really need a haircut

---

ORM
===

* Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)


* Connects your app to your database


* Ruby - objects
* SQL - relations

???

* Today we're going to talk about ORMs in general
    * And one I've been writing in particular
* SQL databases deal with relations
  * Relational algebra
* Ruby deals with objects
* Caveat: there's an "impedance mismatch" between the 2 sides

---

ActiveRecord
============

* Ubiquitous
    * Everyone knows it
    * Lots of people improving it
    * Plugins usually assume you're using it
    * Documentation
* Well-tested
* Well-understood
* Easy to use - it comes with Rails

???

* Who loves ActiveRecord?
* Who hates ActiveRecord?
* Who raised their hand both times?
* Who has had to manually type SQL in an ActiveRecord class?
    * So ActiveRecord is a leaky abstraction
        * SQL leaked up into the upper layers of abstraction
* Who thinks it's crazy to have to look at the class for relationships, but the schema for other attributes?
* I hate ActiveRecord - mostly
* But ActiveRecord is the 800-pount gorilla
* Odds are, if you're hired to work on Rails, you'll be using AR

---

Active Record Pattern
=====================

* Domain logic and persistence logic in same class
* Violates SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)


* ActiveRecord ORM uses this pattern

???

* The biggest problem with AR is that it encourages bad engineering habits
    * This is mostly because it violates the SRP
* Note "Active Record" is the pattern and "ActiveRecord" is the ORM
* Active Record pattern described by Martin Fowler
    * [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture][peap]
* Separation of concerns in important
    * Just like Rails separates M-V-C concerns
    * But ActiveRecord does a terrible job at it
* My experience is that the sweet spot for AR is about 20 model classes
    * Data Mapper pattern has a little more overhead in the number of classes/concepts
        * Pays off a lot as you have more classes
        * Still has a couple advantages with only a few classes

---

Data Mapper Pattern
===================

* Maps between domain objects and the database
* Domain objects don't have to know anything about the database or its schema
* DB schema and model object structure can differ
    * DB schema can change without having to change domain objects
        * Only the mapper changes

???

* Note that the DataMapper Ruby gem didn't actually use the Data Mapper pattern
    * It used the Active Record pattern
* Python's SQL Alchemy uses the Data Mapper pattern
    * This library is very highly regarded --- basically *the* Python ORM

---

Repository Pattern
==================

* Represents a collection of domain objects

???

* In ActiveRecord, the class methods often act as the repository
    * But you can't easily have 2 repositories for the same model class with different data stores
    * Class methods are generally problematic
         * Hard to test

---

Repository Architecture
=======================

* Domain model class handles business logic
* Repository class handles persistence
* Mapper class handles mapping database fields to object attributes

???

* We have a clear separation of concerns
* Sometimes we'll call the domain models entities
    * From [Domain-Driven Design][ddd] book
    * Entities implies that the object is defined by its ID

---

DSLs
====

* Domain-Specific Languages


* Internal DSL
* External DSL

???

* Someone recently asked me what's the difference between a DSL and an API?
    * Anyone have any good answers?
    * Best (but not satisfying) answer was "I know it when I see it"
* I asked Matthias Felleisen, the creator of Racket, the same questions
    * He said (at least in Racket) that a DSL gives DSL-specific error messages
    * I'm not sure we can give DSL-specific error messages in Ruby internal DSLs
* Who knows what the difference between an internal DSL and an external DSL is?
    * An internal DSL is written in the same language as the host language
    * An external DSL is a completely separate language
* SQL is an external DSL.
* ActiveRecord is an internal DSL

---

Ruby Preserves
==============

Trying to answer a few questions:

* How simple can we make an ORM that is still useful?
* Why do we try so hard to hide SQL?
    * Is the added complexity worth it?
* Why don't we just *use* SQL?
    * We have to know SQL anyway
    * All ORMs are very leaky abstractions

???

* Is the complexity of a typical ORM really better than the complexity of SQL?
* A typical ORM uses an internal DSL to generate external DSL code
* What if we made the leaky abstraction leak all the way?

---

Ruby Preserves
==============

Opinions:

* Data Mapper pattern is better than the Active Record pattern
* Regular attributes and relational attributes need to be declared in one place
* NoSQL as a main data store is usually misguided
* Abstracting to allow switching RDBMSes is premature optimization

???

* ActiveRecord is fine if you're just writing a CRUD front-end, with little interesting behavior
* The thing that drives me most crazy about ActiveRecord is having to look in 2 places for things
    * Relationships are defined in the model
    * Attributes are defined in the DB schema
* NoSQL
    * PostgreSQL can do just about anything you need, including what NoSQL does, using SQL
    * See Sarah Mei's article on why to never use MongoDB
    * I spoke w/ someone at Stripe, where MongoDB is their primary DB
        * They copy everything out of it to PostgreSQL for ad-hoc queries
* RDBMS = Relational DataBase Management System
    * Developer workstations are fast enough to run "full" RDBMSes
    * If you're not using "interesting" features, then you're probably using "standard" SQL

---

Domain Model
============

* Can use a Struct, an OStruct, a Virtus model, or a PORO class


~~~ ruby
User = Struct.new(:id, :name, :age, :addresses) do
end

craig = User.new("booch", "Craig", 44, [])

####

class User
  attr_accessor :id
  attr_accessor :name
  attr_accessor :age
  attr_accessor :addresses
end
~~~

???

* PORO = plain old Ruby object
* Note that I can create my model with no database involved

---

Data Mapping
============

~~~ ruby
UserRepository = Preserves.repository(model: User) do
  mapping do
    # The database field named 'username' corresponds to the 'id' attribute in the model.
    map id: 'username'
    # The 'age' field should be mapped to an Integer in the model.
    map :age, Integer
    # The user has a collection of Address objects.
    has_many :addresses, repository: AddressRepository, foreign_key: 'username'
  end
end
~~~

---

Repository Methods
==================

~~~ ruby
UserRepository = Preserves.repository(model: User) do
  def insert(user)
    result = query("INSERT INTO 'users' (username, name, age) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
                   user.id, user.name, user.age)
    raise "Could not insert User #{user.id} into database" unless result.rows == 1
  end

  def older_than(age)
    SQL = "SELECT *, username AS id FROM 'users' WHERE age > ? ORDER BY ?"
    select(SQL, age, :name).to_objects
  end

  def with_id(id)
    SQL = "SELECT *, username AS id FROM 'users' WHERE username = ?"
    select(SQL, id).to_objects
  end
end
~~~

???

* Note that we're still creating singletons for repositories
    * Changing that to a class is on my TODO list

---

Relations
=========

* Has Many
* Belongs To
* Has and Belongs to Many
* Has Many Through

---

N+1 Queries
===========

* Main query gets a collection
* You then iterate through the collection
    * Running another query for each item in the collection

???

* The 1 is the main query
* The N is all the queries for all the items in the collection
* This is an anti-pattern, of course
    * Because if you have 1000 items, you have 1001 SQL queries
    * SQL queries involve network latency, so are slow
* ActiveRecord will sometimes give you N+1 queries
* Usually, this is because you're manually iterating through a collection
* Use a tool like Bullet in Rails to watch for N+1 queries

---

Wrong Turns
===========

* I made a mistake trying to make relations work in Ruby Preserves
* Tried creating proxy objects for every relation
    * So relations weren't queried until they were used
* Was generating SQL in the Ruby Preserves code
* Led to N+1 queries

???

* This was a wrong direction on many fronts
    * It violated the whole principle of using raw SQL
    * It was complex code
    * It generated terrible SQL
* The core idea was fine
    * Don't populate the relations unless they're used
* But it was a learning experience
* It took me a long time to think about how to do relations
    * I took several wrong turns before I came up with something reasonable
    * Even when I was headed in the right direction, it took time to narrow in
    * I'm pretty happy with what I eventually came up with

---

Relations
=========

~~~ ruby
UserRepository = Preserves.repository(model: User) do
  mapping do
    primary_key 'username'
    map id: 'username'
    has_many :addresses, repository: AddressRepository, foreign_key: 'user_id'
  end

  def all
    users = select("SELECT * FROM users")
    addresses = repository.select("SELECT * FROM addresses")
    users.to_objects(mapper, addresses: addresses)
  end
end
~~~

???

* I believe ActiveRecord calls these "associations"
* Note that we have only 2 very simple queries there

---

Advantages
==========

* Domain class contains everything you need to know
    * Don't have to look elsewhere to understand everything a class contains
* Better meets the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
* Small, easy to understand
    * Currently about 200 lines of code
* Encourages better separation of concerns
* Encourages better understanding of SQL
* Experimentation / learning

???

* I think most of the disadvantages should be obvious! ;)

---

Further Work
============

* Optimizations / caching
    * Prepared statements
* Automatically determine mappings, where possible
    * Virtus model attribute definitions
    * Database schema
* Is this really an ORM?
* Is this really the DAO pattern?
* Could this be used in production code?
* Add a layer to write the SQL for us?

???

* DAO = Data Access Object

---

Alternatives
============

1. Lotus::Model
2. Perpetuity
3. ROM
4. Sequel
5. ActiveRecord with declared attributes

???

* Ruby Preserves is nowhere near ready for production
* I still don't have an ORM I'm really happy with
* This is the order I'd currently consider them, for my personal projects
    * Obviously, context matters a lot
* ActiveRecord added attribute declarations in version 4.2
    * Only popularized in 5.0
    * There were plugins available before that
        * Annotate Models and its descendants
        * My own Virtus::ActiveRecord
