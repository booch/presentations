# All Architectures Big and Small

## Elevator Pitch

This is the kind of talk I tend to gravitate towards myself.
Patterns are everywhere. Architecture isn't just about the big stuff.
We ignore "architecture in the small" at our own peril.
We can learn a lot from other fields.


## Description (Abstract)

(This could still use some work.)

We use the term "architecture" in computer programming quite a bit.
But is it a valid and useful analogy (or borrowing of the term)?
What could we learn by taking another look at the architecture of buildings?
What have we missed?
Why do we only consider large architectural issues,
and ignore smaller issues that still might be considered architectural?
We'll take a look at the history of patterns in building architecture,
and how our industry adopted a similar way of thinking.


## Details

(This is a bit sparse at the moment - a lot is just some brainstorming.)

* Show pictures of building architecture
    * Large things that we think of as "architecture"
    * Smaller things that we often don't think of as "architecture"
    * The pictures will be drawn from the patterns in Christopher Alexander's books
* Talk about Christopher Alexander's books
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language
    * Show and talk about some of the patterns
    * Interesting bit I learned recently:
        * He talks about how buildings change over time to adapt
            * This is a primary
* Talk about how Alexander's patterns inspired patterns in computer programming
    * Ward and Kent, according to Kevin Deisz
* Get into computer programming patterns
    * C2 Wiki
    * Gang of Four
    * SBPP (the best book on Ruby, IMHO)
    * POODR (the 2nd-best book on Ruby, IMHO)
* Talk about how some patterns are language-specific
    * Provide examples
        * In assembly language, "Call Subroutine" was a pattern
    * Are patterns just an indication of a feature missing in a language?
        * Sometimes, but not always
    * Be sure to take a look at Neal Ford's talks/work
* Talk about computer architecture "in the small"
    * Like if 3 teams have 5 ways of making a button
        * Find the best of those 5 ways, and ensure everyone uses that
        * Note that context does matter though
            * So there *may* be a reason to keep doing it more than 1 way
* Talk about idioms, and the fuzzy line between patterns and idioms
    * Similar to a "motif" in architecture
* Keep weaving in analogies with building architecture
* See if there's anything pertinent we can pull from Glenn Vanderburg's Real Software Engineering
* The main points I want to get across are:
    * Patterns are everywhere
    * Architecture isn't just about the big stuff
        * We ignore "architecture in the small" at our own peril
    * We can learn a lot from other fields

### Why Me?

* I've done talks about idioms and patterns before
    * This one will be more general
        * This one will talk about the idea of patterns more than individual patterns themselves
* My wife studied architecture as part of her Interior Design degree
    * Christopher Alexander's books were something she studied a bit
    * Knowing that this is where "patterns" came from, I was very interested in her studying of his works
    * We were able to share some conversations around the similarities between the 2 fields
* I nearly talked my way into an architect job once, partly based on talking about architecture the small
* I've read some of Christopher Alexander's patterns book
    * While thinking about how software architecture compares and contrasts


## Other

* If I'm chosen to do the talk, I'll read all of his patterns book, and parts of some of the others
