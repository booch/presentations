## Bio

Craig has been using Ruby and Rails since 2005. He enjoys writing concise readable code, especially in Ruby. He prefers a player-coach role, helping teams improve their processes, technical practices, and automation.

Giving a conference talk is Craig's way to strike up more conversations. If you want to make small talk, ask Craig about traveling, attending concerts, canoeing, beekeeping, or where he was when the pandemic hit.
