# How to Conference

## Abstract

A lot of us techies are introverts. But that shouldn’t stop us from getting the most out of the conferences we attend.

Conferences provide value in 2 main areas - the content and the networking opportunities. In this session, you’ll learn strategies, tactics, and tips for getting better at networking and getting more from your conference experience. (Extroverts welcome too!)

## Details

Subtitle: A Guide for Introverts (And Everyone Else)

A few key points:

- Introverts face some challenges getting the most out of conferences
- With some practice, you can become more outgoing
- Some suggested ice-breakers to start conversations
- “Hacks” to get people to initiate conversations with you

Some example advice I will mention:

- Ask people what talks they’re excited about (towards the beginning)
- Ask people what talks they really liked (towards the end)
- Ask people where they’re from; follow up with some things you know about that place - or want to know
- Hang out with more outgoing friends and have them introduce you to people
    - Ask them to start conversations about topics they know you and the other people are interested in
- When you’re introduced, try to repeat a person’s name 3 times over the next 5 minutes
- Talk to speakers after their talks
- Don’t miss out on the “hallway track”
- Talk to people the least like you; you’ll learn more from their different perspectives

## Pitch

After attending a conference a few years back, a friend and colleague tweeted: “Organizers of future conferences, I really need a talk on how to get better at going to conferences. I’m really bad at networking.”

I thought that was a cool idea. After thinking about the idea and discussing it with my wife, she convinced me that I’d be uniquely qualified to give that talk. I’m naturally an introvert, but I decide many years ago to work on be more outgoing. I had just gone to 3 conferences in 5 weeks, and done a significantly better job at networking than I’d ever done before; the work I’d done was starting to pay off.

I remember being told in college that networking is important, but didn’t really understand what that meant. I didn’t understand how to do it, so I couldn’t understand its importance. I eventually started to understand its importance, but still wasn’t very good at it. I’m still figuring it out, but starting to get the hang of it.

I eventually wrote up the talk and gave it at a local meetup. Now I’d like to share it with a wider audience. Obviously, this would work best during the first set of sessions.
