## Detailed Bio

Craig has been using Ruby and Rails since 2005.
He considers himself a player-coach, striving for continuous improvement and well-engineered, maintainable software.
He joins teams to guide them in improving their processes, technical practices, and ability to work as a team.

Speaking at a conference is a way to strike up conversations.
If you want to make small talk, ask Craig about Long Beach, rock concerts,
canoeing, beekeeping, or where he was when the pandemic hit.
