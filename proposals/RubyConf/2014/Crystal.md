The Crystal Language
====================

Abstract
--------

What if Ruby was a compiled language? It'd be fast!
What if it had type inference? It'd be easier to catch errors!
What if it prevented null pointer references? It'd be awesome!

That's basically what Crystal is.


Details
-------

Crystal is primarily based on Ruby; if you know Ruby, Crystal will be easy to pick up.
Compiled with LLVM, Crystal is fast and easy to interface with C libraries.
Although Crystal is typed, you rarely need to specify type signatures; types can usually be inferred.
Most importantly, the type inference will detect and prevent null pointer exceptions at compile time.


Pitch
-----

I gave a (longer) version of this presentation to the local Ruby users group earlier this year.
The primary Crystal developers attended via video, and it was well received.

I've been contributing to the Crystal standard library.
This has helped me understand its differences from Ruby, its strengths, and its weaknesses.
Working with a new language is exciting; you can have an impact on the design of the language and its libraries, and you get to discover new idioms.

I think the combination of features in Crystal would be of great interest to Rubyists, and the learning curve is quite easy.
The syntax and semantics are about 90% the same as Ruby, so I think it's something RubyConf attendees would be interested in.
