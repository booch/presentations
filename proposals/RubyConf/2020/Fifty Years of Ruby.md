50 Years of Ruby
================

Abstract
--------

Xerox PARC was founded in 1970.
Alan Kay was one of its first employees, working on programming languages, among other things.
He first came up with the ideas behind Smalltalk in 1970.
His first implementation was in 1971, with the first "real" implementation in 1972.

While Ruby was not directly derived from Smalltalk, the two are very similar.
We'll walk through the history of Ruby as it echos the history of Smalltalk.
How did we get here? What can that tell us about where we are headed?

This is definitely a "how did we get here" talk.

* Premise is that Ruby is in many ways a dialect of Smalltalk
    * See Avi Bryant's talk at RailsConf 2007
* Will touch on Englebart's "Mother of All Demos", and how it influenced Kay and PARC

* Where did OOP come from?
    * What are the main ideas behind OOP?
* What else has Alan Kay done?
    * Dynabook, OLPC
