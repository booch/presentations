Better Storytelling
===================


Abstract
--------

Many of us use stories to track what we're working on.
These stories capture the business requirements, in addition to the underlying motivations.

In this presentation, we'll explore several techniques for using stories more effectively.
We'll start with story formats and how they help facilitate discussion.
Then we'll get into the details of automating your stories with Cucumber.
Finally, we'll show some ways to better manage your Cucumber steps.


Details
-------

We'll cover:

* Stories as conversation starters
* Job stories versus user stories
* Using the Gerkhin Given/When/Then format
* When to automate acceptance tests with Cucumber (and why to use the Gerkhin format either way)
* Limiting stories to a single acceptance criteria
* Where to draw the line between acceptance tests, integration tests, and unit tests
* Using the Page Object pattern to manage Cucumber steps

This presentation is appropriate for beginning and intermediate Rubyists,
but I would expect many advanced Rubyists to learn quite a few new things as well.


Pitch
-----

Everyone who uses Cucumber always starts with too much detail.
I recall the "You're Cuking It Wrong" and "You're Cuking It Right" articles from 2010,
when the Ruby community started to figure this out.
But I don't think these ideas have been spread through the community well enough.

I'll share stories from several projects, including Java and CLI apps.
I'll show examples where there's too much detail, and how to fix that.

I've used Cucumber in Ruby and Java projects, teaching several QA folks how to use it effectively.

I've recently started trying out Job Stories, versus User Stories, to facilitate better conversations.

I love speaking at local user groups.
Last year I got to give my first conference talk at RubyConf.
I was very nervous at first, partly because I chose an advanced topic.
But I loved the experience, and have had the chance to speak at a few conferences this year.
I'm hoping to speak at RubyConf again, since it's the community that I most identify and connect with.
