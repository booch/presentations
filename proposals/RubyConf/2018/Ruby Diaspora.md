The Ruby Diaspora
=================


Abstract
--------

One of the best things about Ruby is the community.
But we've had some great people leave for other languages.
Why did they leave?
What values and lessons did they take with them?
What can we learn from the communities they've joined?


Details
-------

I'd like to talk to various people who have left our community.
(In some cases, they're still in our community, but also in another.)
Off the top of my head, I would like to talk to:

* José Valim - Elixir
* Yehuda Katz - Ember JS
* James Edward Gray II - Elm, Elixir
* Sean Griffin - Rust (Diesel ORM)
* Stuart Halloway or David Chelimsky - Clojure
* Chad Fowler?

I suspect that I may come up with a few more.

I plan to ask them the questions from the abstract:

* Why did you move to a different language/community?
* What values and lessons did you take with you?
    * How did you apply them to the new language/community?
* What can we in the Ruby community learn from the community you joined?

I'm sure the conversations will flow from there into various related topics.

It'd be interesting to find if there's any significant diaspora to:

* TypeScript
* F#
* OCaml, ReasonML, BuckleScript
* Haskell

It might also be interesting to think about new languages
where there does not seem to be a significant Ruby diaspora:

* Go
* Perl 6
* Kotlin


Pitch
-----

There's a chance that I'll get to do a podcast on this topic,
whether this talk is selected or not.

I believe that the answers to the questions I've posed are important to our community.
As Ruby and its community mature, we'll need to understand what we're doing well,
and what we could be doing better.

Along the way, the audience will also get a better idea of where Ruby
fits within the wider community.

I hope that this talk will encourage attendees both to explore other languages
and to get involved in making Ruby and its community a better place.
I intend to make that explicit at the end of the talk.
