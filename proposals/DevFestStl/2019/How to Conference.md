How to Conference: A Guide for Introverts
=========================================

Abstract
--------

A lot of us techies are introverts.
But that shouldn't stop us from getting the most out of the conferences we attend.
Conferences provide value in 2 main areas - the content and the networking opportunities.
In this session, you'll learn strategies, tactics, and tips for getting better at networking
and getting more from your conference experience.


Pitch
-----

After attending a conference a few years back, a friend and colleague tweeted:
"Organizers of future conferences, I really need a talk on how to get better at going to conferences.
I'm really bad at networking."

I thought that was a cool idea.
After thinking about the idea and discussing it with my wife,
she convinced me that I'd be uniquely qualified to give that talk.
I'm naturally an introvert, but I decide many years ago to work on be more outgoing.
I had just gone to 3 conferences in 5 weeks, and done a significantly better job at networking than I'd ever done before;
the work I'd done was starting to pay off.

I remember being told in college that networking is important, but didn't really understand what that meant.
I didn't understand how to do it, so I couldn't understand its importance.
I eventually started to understand its importance, but still wasn't very good at it.
I'm still figuring it out, but starting to get the hang of it.

I eventually wrote up the talk and gave it at a local meetup.
Now I'd like to share it with a wider audience.

A few key points:

* Introverts face some challenges getting the most out of conferences
* With some practice, you can become more outgoing
* Some suggested ice-breakers to start conversations
* "Hacks" to get people to initiate conversations with you

Some example advice I plan to mention:

* Ask people what talks they're excited about (towards the beginning)
* Ask people what talks they really liked (towards the end)
* Ask people where they're from; follow up with some things you know about that place - or want to know
* Hang out with more outgoing friends and have them introduce you to people
    * Ask them to start conversations about topics they know you and the other people are interested in
* When you're introduced, try to repeat a person's name 3 times over the next 5 minutes
* Talk to speakers after their talks
    * Preferably not *right* after, though
* Don't miss out on the "hallway track"
* Talk to people the least like you; you'll learn more from their different perspectives

Other thoughts
--------------

* Talk about how many of us are assholes
    * We're used to being right, and don't know how to be wrong
        * We don't know how, because we haven't had much practice
    * We have to be careful, and work on this aspect of ourselves as well
