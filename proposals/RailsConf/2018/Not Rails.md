Framework != Rails
==================

Abstract
--------

We all love Rails.
We're at a Rails conference, after all.
But is Rails always the right choice?
Let's take a brief look at some alternatives:

* Hanami
* Sinatra / Padrino
* Trailblazer
* Roda
* Grape
* Phoenix (Elixir)
* Kemal (Crystal)

What are the pros and cons of each?
When should we consider each of these alternatives?


Details
-------

This will obviously be a whirlwind tour, with only about 5 minutes per framework.
I'll focus primarily on the differences from Rails.
A few examples:

* Grape is good for API micro-services
* Phoenix and Kemal are highly performant
    * Response times are often measured in microseconds
    * Elixir takes some time to learn
    * Crystal only takes a little time to learn
* Trailblazer builds upon Rails or Hanami
    * Service objects (operations)
    * Validation objects
    * Policy objects
* Roda is based on a routing tree
    * Faster than Sinatra
    * Everything else comes from plugins
* Hanami is built using the Clean Architecture pattern
    * Apps are built around interactors, which perform the business logic
        * A CLI and a web app can be built from the same set of interactors
    * Entities and repositories are separated
* Padrino is a loose collection of tools to use atop Sinatra

I'll also very briefly mention other web frameworks in other, unrelated languages:

* Lift (Scala)
* Spring Boot (Java)
* Play (Java, Scala)
* Express (JavaScript)
* Django (Python)
* Laravel (PHP)
* Grails (Groovy)

For each of those, I'll likely just show 1 neat feature, and mention 1 reason you might consider it.
(Usually that's due to language constraints the team or company imposes.)

I won't really get into any client-side frameworks, due to time, but also due to the fact that they need back-end API services.


Pitch
-----

I'd like to expose people to the alternatives.
While Rails is the 800-pound gorilla, the other players also have their place.
Perhaps more importantly, I want to expose people to ideas in other frameworks that don't exist in Rails.

As a practical matter, it's also good to know the available options,
so you can make an educated choice when one of the other options is more ideal in a given situation.

I've used several of the alternatives, and investigated most of the others.
Being selected to give this presentation would give me the excuse I need to explore all the frameworks in some more depth.
