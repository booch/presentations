How The Internet Works
======================

Track: Explain It Like I'm Five


Abstract (public, 600 characters)
--------

Most of us work and play on the Internet every day. But how well do we really know the Internet? What even **is** the Internet? How does it actually work?

We'll explore the different layers and protocols of Internet network traffic. We'll focus in a bit on HTTP, the language web servers and web browsers use to communicate. But we'll also talk about other traffic that flows across the Internet.

Details (outlines, outcomes, intended audience, etc.)

Intended Audience: any

HTTP and the Web are just a small part of the larger story of the Internet. We'll explore the layers, bottom-up and top-down. I want to tell the story of how the Internet came to be, but more importantly, I want to tell the story of how and why it works.

Outline ideas:
* DNS
* ISO model
* TCP/IP model
* ARP
* HTTP
* SMTP
* IMAP
* IANA
* ARIN
* IP
* Subnets, CIDR
* TCP
* Ethernet
* WiFi
* 5G
* Tunnels, VPNs
* Security


Pitch
-----

I've given similar talks, focusing in on HTTP and the Web. For this talk, I'll pull the focus back to the wider Internet.

This is the kind of talk that I enjoy and get the best feedback on â€” presenting a topic with a lot of breadth and detail. I'm hoping to tell this more like a story than my typical talks.

In a previous life, I was a network admin, maintaining firewalls at a Fortune 500 company. One of my roles was troubleshooting traffic as it was going through the firewalls. Often this involved tracing network packets at various layers. I had several network certifications in the early 2000s, including CCNA and Network+.
