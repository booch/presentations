Building a Gem
==============

Abstract
--------

Got some Ruby code to share? Want people to give you feedback? Or patches?
Push it to GitHub. But don't stop there! Publish it as a gem.

Building a gem is pretty easy. We can do it in 30 minutes --- and do it well.
We'll create a new gem, write the README, write some tests, write code
to pass the tests, push to GitHub, and publish the gem. We'll follow all
the "best practices", so we end up with a gem that works well out of the box.


Details
-------

I'll be sure to do some research into best practices, so the way we
teach people to create gems will be the best we can. For example, we'll
generate the gem with `bundle gem`. We'll do some README-driven TDD.
We'll incorporate Ernie Miller's suggested `rake console`.

We'll talk a bit about semantic versioning and the `~>` (twiddle-wakka)
pessimistic version constraint for dependencies.


Pitch
-----

I've recently published a few small gems. I probably would have done
this sooner had I realized how easy it is. I'd written a couple gems
before, but was always pulling them from GitHub. It's so simple, I 
feel like I need to share it with the world.

I've done live coding at the local LUG and RUG meetings several times.
Lots of practice runs ensures it'll go relatively smoothly.
