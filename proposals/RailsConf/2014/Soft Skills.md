What They Don't Teach In School -- Or Work -- Or Tech Conferences
=================================================================

Abstract
--------

You didn't come to a Rails conference to learn about "soft skills".
As developers, we're more focused on learning new technical skills.
As a community, we're not very good at teaching soft skills either.

But the most difficult things to learn are usually the most important.
This presentation will provide some tips and tricks to improve the way
we work, and the way we work with others.


Details
-------

[If you need to trim the title, take out the " -- Or Work". If you still
need to trim it, change "Tech Conferences" to "RailsConf".]

Many of these tips come from the Agile community, but we won't talk 
much about Agile itself -- just how these particular practices are
helpful.

Some points I'd like to make (along with ways to deal with them):

* Interacting with people is the most important skill for a developer
* Customers aren't always right, but they're the reason we do what we do
* We get "stuck" all the time, but usually don't realize it
* It can be hard to tell when you've completed a task
* We're really bad at estimating, even when we take that into account
* We're bad at designing APIs, because we don't think in terms of the consumer
* Sharpen your tools; practice using them more effectively
* Always be making improvements to the way you work


Pitch
-----

In my 20+ year career in IT, my concentration on learning has changed
quite significantly. For the longest time, the technologies were always
the main focus. That's still important to me (and I never want to stop
learning more about technical topics), but then I started to focus on the
process of writing software. How can we improve the way we work? More
recently, I've been focusing on the people skills. How can we improve
the way we work together?

I worked several years for a company that's a leader in practicing Agile.
I've tried most of the Agile practices, and understand most of the rest.
I've worked on a couple Agile transformation projects. These are the 
most interesting, because you have to change not only how people work,
but how they think about things. The points I want to cover are mostly
the concepts that people have the most difficulty with in how they
think about them.
