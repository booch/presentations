How to Conference: A Guide for Introverts
=========================================

Abstract
--------

A lot of us techies are introverts.
But that shouldn't stop us from getting the most out of the conferences we attend.
Conferences provide value in 2 main areas - the content and the networking opportunities.
In this session, we'll provide strategies, tactics, and tips for getting better at networking.


Slides
------

NOTE: The top-level bullet points describe the slide. The lower-level bullet points will be notes for the spoken words to go with the slides.

- Pic of Deech's tweet that inspired the talk (https://twitter.com/deech/status/647402119969013760)
  - Aditya Siram (Deech) posted this during Strange Loop 2015
  - I responded with several tips
  - After discussing the Twitter conversation with my wife, she told me *I* should give that talk

- Pic of "Shy Guy's Guide to Dating"
  - I'm a naturally shy person (mostly)
  - But I decided 15 or 20 years ago to work to be more outgoing
  - I actually owned this book, when I was dating

- Dictionary definition of "ambivert"
  - Today I consider myself to be an ambivert
  - I still have a lot of situations where I'm an introvert
  - But there are a lot of situations where I'll at least appear to be an extrovert
  - I'm still making progress
    - Strange Loop 2015, and 2 conferences the week before, were a real turning point for me
      - I networked a *lot* better than I had before - and felt almost natural at it

- Definition of introvert and extrovert that talk about how we recharge
  - Inside, I still feel like an introvert most of the time
    - But even that's starting to change

- Pic of a large audience
  - BTW, one of my biggest fears is speaking in front of a large crowd
  - My "number" is about 50 -- more than that, and I get nervous
  - It usually takes me a couple Xanax
    - A couple Xanax would normally put me to sleep
  - But the feeling after I finish is *amazing* -- I feel pumped up
    - And the value to me (and to others) is worth it
  - And yes, I know you shouldn't talk about how nervous you are in your talk
    - Except that it's actually on-topic for this talk

- Pic of a newspaper???
  - The good news:
    - You can make a lot of progress
  - The bad news:
    - It's going to take a lot of practice and a lot of time

- Pic of Jessitron's tweet on awkwardness (https://twitter.com/jessitron/status/648339760310697984) [get permission]
  - I think she's right
  - But awkwardness can also be a step toward breaking through your own social defenses
  - For most in this room, we probably face more of the latter than the former
    - Of course, figuring out which is which is hard (and often necessary)

- Pic of planes, trains, and automobiles (or a clip from the movie) (or someone sleeping on a plane)
  - Plan your travel so as to reduce stress as much as possible
    - Don't cut it close -- that's too stressful
    - My anecdote about not having a room in Chicago when I arrived

- Pic of an icebreaker ship (or the gum)
  - Here are a few easy ice breakers at a conference:
    - Ask people what talks they're excited about (towards the beginning)
    - Ask people what talks they really liked (towards the end)
    - Ask people where they're from
      - You can follow up with some things you know about that place - or want to know
      - You can ask them how their trip in was
      - You can follow up with if they've ever been to this city or this conference before
      - I had an Aussie at Strange Loop last year tell me that Americans ask this question more than anyone
        - Then I asked him where he was from, and he pointed out that I just did what he said Americans always do
    - Ask people what do they do (for a living)

- Pic of ??? (Jessiton? [with her permission, of course])
  - Hang out with more outgoing friends and have them introduce you to people
    - Ask them to start conversations about topics they know you and the other people are interested in

- Pic of My Name Is badge (preferably with Inigo Montoya filled in)
  - Who here is bad with names? I am!
  - When you are introduced, try to repeat the person's name
    - Then try to use it again in a few minutes
    - Then try to use it again a while later
  - Try to write names down as soon as you can

- ???
  - Purposely join different groups
  - If you can, try NOT to stick with people you know the whole time
  - Ask random people if you can tag along with them for dinner
  - Helena had a great line once: "you look like some people I don't know yet"

- ???
  - Talk to speakers after their talks
    - Ask follow up questions
    - Ask where you can get more info
    - Argue a point (maybe)
  - It's probably better to try to talk to them later than *right* after their talk
  - How many of you feel like it would be intruding to talk to a speaker?
    - It's not
    - Either they're an extrovert, and generally don't mind talking to people
    - Or they're an introvert, and using their as a way to get people to talk to them
  - Just don't monopolize their time

- ???
  - Skip some sessions
  - The "hallway track" is important
    - It's also easier, because there are a lot less people in the hallways during a session

- Pic of a blues band in a small bar
  - Invite people you know to an after-event
    - People you "know" from the Internet
    - People you know, and people you don't know
    - Use whatever means of communication is available for the conference
      - Twitter hash tag
      - Slack channel
  - Deech and I like Blues music
    - Who wants to come with us to BoB or BB's or BOB tonight?

- Pic of my badge addition - Ask Me About / Tell Me About
  - Add to your badge a short list of things you'd like to talk about
  - I wish some conferences would start adopting this idea

- Pic of WindyCityRails speaker in Storm Trooper outfit (ask his permission)
  - Wear something outrageous, so people will come talk to you
    - Maybe just a wild color in your hair
  - In some ways, this might be a way to hide behind the outrageousness

- Pic and audio of a noisy bar or something similar (with a DON'T symbol over it)
  - Who has trouble hearing people talk in noisy places?
    - I do. It's the worst!
  - ????
    - I don't really have much good advice on this one
    - I'm still really bad at this
  - Only thing I've got is to tell people that they need to speek up, because you're a bit hard of hearing

- Picture of someone (me?) on stage giving a talk
  - Give a talk
  - Start with a smaller group and work your way to larger groups
  - People will come up to you and want to talk more with you about your topic

- Pic of Camille Fournier's Trade / Offs slide [get permission]
  - At Strange Loop 2015, Camille Fournier talked about trade-offs
    - Engineering is measuring trade-offs and deciding which is better for the situation
  - Choosing to be more outgoing is a trade-off
    - Cons - you feel awkward, it's hard, it takes time
    - Pros - you meet new people, you learn new things, you connect to your community and the world

- Pic of the earth???
  - For me, connecting with the world and my community is important
  - I hope it's important to you too
  - And I hope that you'll find your own ways to get better at doing that

Other thoughts
--------------

- Talk about how many of us are assholes
  - We're used to being right, and don't know how to be wrong
    - We don't know how, because we haven't had much practice
  - We have to be careful, and work on this aspect of ourselves as well
