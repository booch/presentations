Why is This White Guy Talking to Us About Diversity?
====================================================

Abstract (300 characters)
--------

We claim our industry is a meritocracy, where everyone is judged solely on their skills.
But that's just a story we tell ourselves to make us feel good.
Let's dig deeper and see if we can tell a better story.


Description (public)
-----------

Our industry has a problem.
We're not treating everyone equitably, but we won't admit it.

Then let's see how we can discover the truth.
And let's find out how facing this truth help us as an industry.

* It's the right thing to do morally and ethically
* Richness of experiences
* Inclusivity



Notes (reviewers only)
-----

First of all, I'd gladly give up my spot to have a non-white-guy speak on this topic in my stead.

* TODO: My journey

Some points I want to cover:

* Inclusivity is a moral and ethical imperative
* Diversity is good for business
* Diversity is good for everybody
* We all come with cognitive biases
* We can't recognize all of our biases
* It's not a pipeline issue (with data)
* Being an ally is hard
* Racism, gender bias, etc. are systemic

My conclusion will be a call to action to get out there and help people.
