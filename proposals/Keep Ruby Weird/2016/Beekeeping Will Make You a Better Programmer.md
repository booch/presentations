Beekeeping Will Make You a Better Programmer
============================================

Abstract (300 characters)
--------

What can programmers learn from beekeepers?
It turns out that there are a lot of similarities.
In this presentation, we'll learn about bees and beekeeping,
and find some lessons we can apply to programming.

Description (public)
-----------

Earlier this year, I took up beekeeping as a hobby.
It's really quite interesting, and I've learned a lot.
I want to share with you some of the things I've learned.

And since I won't have any honey to extract this year,
I'll extract some lessons that can be applied to programming.

Notes (reviewers only)
-----

I've been in the IT industry for over 20 years,
and I recently took up beekeeping.
Beekeeping is a lot different than I had expected.
I was surprised to notice quite a few parallels between beekeeping and programming:

* You need to buy some (somewhat expensive) equipment to get started
* You can do it as a hobby, as a business, or somewhere in between
* There's a lot to learn, and the depth of learning is surprising
* It's not for everyone
* Mentoring (pairing) is encouraged
* No 2 people agree on how to do things
* Keeping notes is important
* It's not just you that you're affecting
* You will get stung sometimes
    * Usually it's because you weren't careful
* There are local user groups to support you
* Lots of people/bees are depending on you, but really, just don't screw up
* You get better over time, more confident, until it becomes second nature
* The colony is self organizing
    * Each bee has a role to play
        * The role varies by age and what the colony needs
        * If the queen dies, she can be replaced
    * The queen is not "in charge"
        * She's more of a servant leader
        * She has her own role
        * She probably has the hardest job
* There's a serious gender imbalance

I know I won't have time to cover them all, but I should be able to touch on most of them.
My basic plan is to just talk about bees and beekeeping,
and talk about the lessons as they pertain to the topic at hand.

Additional Info / How is your talk “keeping it weird”?
------------------------------------------------------

Well, I think it's pretty weird to talk about bees at a Ruby conference.
But I'm excited to talk to other people about the topic.
And I really do think I can make an interesting talk where people learn about bees and beekeeping,
while while drawing parallel lessons that they can apply to their lives.

I frequently give talks at local user groups, and have given a few conference talks.
This would be a different kind of talk than I normally give,
with more pictures, more story-telling, and fewer bullet points.
I'd likely give the talk at a local group before the conference as a practice run.
