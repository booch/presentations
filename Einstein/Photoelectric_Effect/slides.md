* Was in German until 1950
    * English and German between 1950 and 1990
    * All English as of 1990
* Peer reviewed
    * But not in Einstein's days

# Photoelectric Effect

![photons hitting a metal surface, and electrons being emitted from that surface](images/Photoelectric_Effect.png)

---

# Photoelectric Effect

* When atoms absorb energy from light, electrons are emitted


* Mostly seen in metals
* Discovered by Heinrich Hertz in 1887

???

* Other related effects:
    * photoconductive effect (photoconductivity/photoresistivity)
    * photovoltaic effect
    * photoelectrochemical effect

---

# Photoelectric Effect

* Photosynthesis
* Used to make solar cells
* Photodiodes

---

# Photoelectric Effect

* Causes spacecraft exposed to sunlight to develop a positive charge
* Light from the sun hitting lunar dust causes it to become positively charged

???

* Imbalance can discharge through delicate electrical components

* Charged dust then repels itself and lifts off the surface of the moon by electrostatic levitation
    * Smallest particles might be repelled kilometers from the surface in "fountains"

---

# Photoelectric Effect

* Energy of individual emitted electrons increased with the *frequency* of the light
    * Discovered by Philipp Lenard in 1902
    * At odds with Maxwell's wave theory of light
        * It predicted that electron energy would be proportional to *intensity* of the light

# Black Body Radiation

![Thermal image of a house](images/Thermal_Imaging.jpg)

---

# Black Body Radiation

* Idealized physical body that absorbs all incoming electromagnetic radiation
    * Regardless of frequency or angle of incidence
    * Can emit radiation
        * Cannot reflect or transmit electromagnetic radiation

---

# Black Body Radiation

* A black body in thermal equilibrium emits electromagnetic radiation
    * The light emitted is called black-body radiation
    * Radiation is emitted according to Planck's law
    * It has a spectrum that is determined by the temperature alone

---

# Introduction

* Matter is built of atoms and electrons
    * Discrete particles

---

# Introduction

* Light (per Maxwell's theory) is described by wave functions
    * Continuous waves
    * Energy of a light wave emitted from a point source gets increasingly spread out and diffuse over an ever larger volume

---

# Introduction

* Generation and transformation of light seem better modeled by quantized particles
    * Finite number of energy quanta
    * Spatially localized at points of space,
    * Move without dividing
    * Absorbed or generated only as a whole

???

* "The wave theory of light with its continuous spatial functions has proven to be an excellent model of purely optical phenomena,
and presumably will never be replaced by another theory."

* "Despite the perfect agreement of Maxwell's theory with experiment,
the use of continuous spatial functions to describe light may lead to contradictions with experiments,
especially when applied to the generation and transformation of light."

---

# Introduction

* Proposes that "photons" are real
    * Previously proposed by Planck
    * Term "photon" was not coined until 1926

???

He then goes on to propose that light may instead be made up of quanta

---

# Einstein's Thought Experiment

* Imagine a room with perfectly reflecting walls
* In the room is a "black body", some gas molecules, and some free electrons
