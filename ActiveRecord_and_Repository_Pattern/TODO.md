    * The one from the single picture slides

    * Books SVG from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MediaWiki-Virtual-Library-icon.svg
        * Maybe use a modified version of this instead: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Building2.svg
        * Would really like it to look more like https://www.istockphoto.com/vector/red-library-cartoon-building-icon-gm695924018-128844785
        * Also like something like https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/2002876/databank_database_repository_server_storage_icon
        * Also like something like https://www.maxpixel.net/Shelves-Library-Interior-Cornell-University-Books-82344
