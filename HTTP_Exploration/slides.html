class: http-request

HTTP Request
============

<pre><code>
<span class="method">PUT</span> <span class="url_path">https://www.google.com/</span> HTTP/1.1
<span class="headers">Host: google.com</span>
<span class="headers">Content-Length: 38</span>
<span class="blank"> </span>
<span class="body">Haha, I've updated Google's home page!</span>
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li><span class="method">Method</span></li>
  <li><span class="url_path">URL path</span></li>
  <li><span class="headers">Headers</span></li>
  <li><span class="body">Body</span></li>
</ul>

???

* Request line - contains the method, URL path, and protocol

---

HTTP Methods
============

* GET
* POST
* PUT
* DELETE
* HEAD

???

* Sometimes called "verbs"
* There are a few other methods
    * OPTIONS
    * TRACE
    * CONNECT
* There are also some extensions to HTTP that add methods
    * PATCH - RFC 5789
    * WebDAV - RFCs 2518, 4918, and many more
* Note that proxies/firewalls might restrict methods you can use

---

Safe Methods
============

* Do not have any effect on information
* GET, HEAD

???

* Takeaway = Don't have your app change things when processing `GET` requests.
    * Except logging and such.

---

Idempotent Methods
==================

* Can call multiple times without any additional effect
* GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE

???

* Takeaway = Don't POST the same thing multiple times.

---

Request Headers
===============

* Host
* Accept
* Content-Length
* Content-Type
* Referer
* User-Agent

???

* Host - the only *required* header (except pre-HTTP/1.0)
* Accept - lists content types that the browser would like
    * Can specify relative quality factor for each type
* Content-Length - size of the body (if applicable -- POST and PUT)
* Content-Type - MIME type of body
    * Forms: Usually `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`
    * APIs: Typically `application/json` or `text/xml`
* Referer (spelled incorrectly) - page with link the user clicked
* User-Agent - string describing browser (or other HTTP client)

---

Request Headers
===============

* Authorization
* Accept-Encoding
* Connection
* Cookie

???

* Authorization - provides login info (for popups)
* Accept-Encoding - gzip or deflate
    * New one called Brotli (`br` in the header)
        * MacOS utility: `brew install zopfli`
* Connection - keep-alive
* Cookie - return a cookie that the server has previously handed us

---
class: http-response

HTTP Response
=============

<pre><code>HTTP/1.0 <span class="status_code">201</span> Created
<span class="headers">Location: https://www.google.com/</span>
<span class="headers">Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8</span>
<span class="blank"> </span>
<span class="body">{"rubyconf": "awesome", "day": 3}</span>
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li><span class="status_code">Status code</span></li>
  <li><span class="headers">Headers</span></li>
  <li><span class="body">Body</span></li>
</ul>

???

* Status line - contains protocol, status code, and status description

---

Response Status Codes
=====================

* 100s - Informational
* 200s - Success
    * 200 - OK
    * 201 - Created
* 300s - Redirection
    * 301 - Moved Permanently
    * 304 - Not Modified

---

Response Status Codes
=====================

* 400s - Client Error
    * 401 - Unauthorized
    * 403 - Forbidden
    * 404 - Not Found
    * 407 - Proxy Authentication Required
    * 422 - Unprocessable Entity
* 500s - Server Error
    * 500 - Internal Server Error
    * 502 - Bad Gateway
    * 504 - Gateway Timeout

???

* 405 - Method Not Allowed
* 418 - I'm a teapot

---

Response Headers
================

* Content-Length
* Content-Type
* Content-Encoding
* Content-Disposition
* Location
* Set-Cookie
* WWW-Authenticate

???

* Content-Encoding - body has been gzip or deflated
* Content-Disposition - used to tell browser to download instead of display
    * Can also provide a default filename to save as
* Location - browser should redirect to the value of this header
* Set-Cookie - tells browser to remember a token to pass back next time
    * This is how we get statefulness in a stateless protocol
* WWW-Authenticate - asks for user to authenticate (via browser popup)

---

Proxies
=======

* Proxy - something that acts in place of another


* Web proxies intercept HTTP requests
  * Can modify the request or response
  * Can modify headers or body content

---

Proxies
=======

* Good for caching
* Can add security
    * SSL termination / offloading
    * Authentication


* Transparent vs. non-transparent
* Reverse vs. forward

???

* Transparent means we don't need to tell our user-agent about it
* Reverse proxy (always transparent) is near the server(s)
* Forward proxy is near the client(s)

---

CDNs
====

* Content delivery network
* Caching proxies for static content
* Content is distributed
* Content is placed closer to more clients
* BGP Anycast for DNS servers
    * Determines which content server is closest


* DDoS protection

---

Troubleshooting
===============

* ping
* traceroute
* telnet
* netstat -plant (on servers)
* openssl s_client (HTTPS)
* tcpdump
* Wireshark

???

* Mac `netstat` takes only `-na`, not `-plt`
    * Pipe it to `grep LISTEN`

* You can capture with `tcpdump` and view in Wireshark

* Consider the various layers of the OSI model
    * ping, traceroute = network layer
    * telnet = transport layer
    * s_client = presentation layer

---

HTTP/2
======

* Google SPDY project
* Header compression (HPACK)
* TLS required by every implementation
    * Not really related to HTTP/2
    * Probably due to use of ALPN TLS extension
* Binary framing instead of text-based
    * Same semantics as HTTP/1.1 though
* http://http2.github.io/

???

* HTTP/2 has only been around a couple years
    * But it's available in almost all browsers now
    * It's available in most web servers now
    * Not in most app servers
        * Use an HTTP/2 proxy
    * Not in many proxy servers
* ALPN = Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation

---

HTTP/2
======

* Multiplexed connections
    * Grab multiple resources simultaneously
        * Over a single TCP connection
* Server push
* Removes the need to combine JS, CSS, and images
* Starts with an HTTP/1.1 connection using `Upgrade` and `HTTP2-Settings` headers
    * Returns a 101 status code (Switching Protocols)

???

* Chrome and Google can also use QUIC
    * Basically best of UDP and TCP transport layer

---

HTTP/2 - Support
================

* Chrome 41
* Firefox 36
* IE 11 - only in Windows 10
* Nginx 1.9.5
* cURL 4.x
    * With `--http2` flag, if feature compiled in
* Wireshark 1.99
* Apache 2.4.17
    * mod_http2

???

* Unfortunately (in 2015), I couldn't get cURL and Nginx to cooperate
    * Had to compile OpenSSL 1.0.2 and cURL 7.41 with nghttp2
    * They used NPN instead of ALPN

Exercises
=========

http://craigbuchek.com/http-workshop

* Tip: Hit `P` to toggle presenter notes

???

See? Presenter Notes!

---

Telnet - HTTP/0.9
=================

Use telnet, but don't specify a version of HTTP:

~~~ bash
telnet http-workshop.boochtek.com 80
~~~

~~~
GET http://http-workshop.boochtek.com/
~~~

Note that you couldn't specify request headers
Note that there are no response headers

---

Telnet - HTTP/1.0
=================

Use telnet, and specify HTTP/1.0 in the request:

~~~ bash
telnet http-workshop.boochtek.com 80
~~~

~~~
GET http://http-workshop.boochtek.com/ HTTP/1.0
Host: localhost

~~~

Note that you need a blank line after the last header

---

Telnet - HTTP/1.1
=================

Use telnet, specifying HTTP/1.1:

~~~ bash
telnet http-workshop.boochtek.com 80
~~~

~~~
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: http-workshop.boochtek.com

~~~

Note that you don't need the protocol and server in the request line (except HTTP/0.9)

How does this differ from HTTP/1.0?
  * Hint: Hit Control+C

---

Wget
====

Use wget:

~~~ bash
wget -d http://http-workshop.boochtek.com/
~~~

Where did it put the result?

* Tip: Use `-o` to specify the output file

???

* Mac Homebrew wget doesn't support `-d` out of the box
  * `brew reinstall wget --with-debug`

---

cURL
====

Use cURL:

~~~ bash
curl -v http://http-workshop.boochtek.com/
curl -v http://http-workshop.boochtek.com/reflect
~~~

Note the leading `*`, `>`, and `<` characters
  * What does each prefix character mean?

???

* `>` indicates traffic being sent from client to server
* `<` indicates traffic being sent back from the server to the client
* `*` indicates information about the connection between the client and server

---

HTTPie
======

Use HTTPie:

~~~ bash
http -v http://http-workshop.boochtek.com/
http -v http://http-workshop.boochtek.com/reflect X-Extra:Cool
http --style=xcode -v http://http-workshop.boochtek.com/
~~~

What's different about this output compared to cURL?
  * Which do you prefer?

???

* Note: You can use `http` in place of `curl` in most of the following exercises if you want

---

Redirect
========

Let's see what a redirect looks like:

~~~ bash
curl -v http://http-workshop.boochtek.com/reflect
http -v --follow http://http-workshop.boochtek.com/reflect
~~~

Notice the status code and `Location` header

Now let's follow the redirect

~~~ bash
curl -v -L http://http-workshop.boochtek.com/reflect
~~~

---

POST
====

Let's see what a POST looks like:

~~~ bash
curl -v -X POST http://http-workshop.boochtek.com/post -d key=value -d http=fun
http -v POST http://http-workshop.boochtek.com/post key=value http=fun
~~~

Note the request body being sent

---

Caching
=======

Let's see how a cache would use headers:

~~~ bash
URL='http://http-workshop.boochtek.com/etag'
curl -v http://http-workshop.boochtek.com/etag
ETAG=$(curl -v $URL 2>&1 | grep Etag: | sed -e 's/.*"\(.*\)"/\1/')
curl -v -H "If-None-Match: $ETAG" http://http-workshop.boochtek.com/etag
MODIFIED=$(curl -v $URL 2>&1 | grep Last-Modified: | sed -e 's/.*: \(.*\)/\1/')
curl -v -H "If-Modified-Since: $MODIFIED" http://http-workshop.boochtek.com/etag
~~~

Note the status code when we supply the headers

Note that when we get a `304`, there's no body content included

???

That crazy complicated stuff is just grabbing the content of the appropriate headers

Note how the names of the request tags and response tags go together
  * Response: `ETag` -> Request: `If-None-Match`
  * Response: `Last-Modified` -> Request: `If-Modified-Since`

---

HTTPS - Telnet
==============

Try to telnet to an HTTPS server:

~~~ bash
telnet www.google.com 443
~~~

~~~
GET / HTTP/1.0
Host: www.google.com

~~~

What happens? Why?

---

HTTPS - OpenSSL
===============

Try using OpenSSL `s_client` instead:

~~~ bash
openssl s_client -connect www.google.com:443
~~~

~~~
GET / HTTP/1.0
Host: www.google.com

~~~

* Tip: Check out the `-pause` and `-debug` options to `s_client`

---

HTTPS - HTTPie
==============

Try using HTTPie instead:

~~~ bash
http -v HEAD https://www.google.com/
~~~

---

HTTPS - cURL
============

Try using cURL instead:

~~~ bash
curl -v -X HEAD https://www.google.com/
~~~

---

Non-Transparent Proxy
=====================

Proxy your requests through Squid (on port 3128):

~~~ bash
curl -v --proxy localhost:3128 http://http-workshop.boochtek.com/
curl -v --proxy localhost:3128 http://http-workshop.boochtek.com/reflect
http -v --proxy http:http://localhost:3128 http://http-workshop.boochtek.com/
http_proxy=http://localhost:3128 curl -v http://http-workshop.boochtek.com/
~~~

What did the proxy change?

???

Bonus: Take a look at the bottom of `/etc/squid3/squid.conf`

---

Reverse Proxy
=============

Using Nginx as a reverse proxy to add TLS security:

~~~ bash
curl -v --insecure https://http-workshop.boochtek.com/
http -v --verify=no https://http-workshop.boochtek.com/
~~~

Note: We're ignoring invalid SSL certs here -- never do this!
  * You would be vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack

???

Note that we've configured Nginx to use SSL and proxy to port 80

Bonus: Take a look at the bottom of `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`

~~~ bash
sudo service rails_app stop
~~~

---

HTTP/2
======

Use cURL to hit Google using HTTP/2:

~~~ bash
curl -v --http2 -X HEAD https://www.google.com/
~~~

Note: We had to manually compile OpenSSL and cURL to make this work
  * We still couldn't get it to work against Nginx's SPDY

---

Web Browsers
============

Try some of the above exercises using a browser on your host OS

* The Rails app is exposed on port 3333
* The Nginx HTTPS proxy is exposed on port 4444
  * It should have SPDY/3.1 enabled

* Tip: Take a look at the Network tab in Developer Tools

---

TUI Browsers
============

Try some of the above exercises using a TUI-based browser

* lynx
* links
* elinks
* w3m

What are the differences between these browsers?
  * Which do you like best?

???

TUI = Text-based User Interface, basically a GUI in the terminal

---

Netstat
=======

See what services are listening on what ports:

~~~ bash
sudo netstat -plant
~~~

???

This is helpful in determining if your app is listening on the port you think it is

Mac `netstat` takes only `-na`, not `-plt`
  * Pipe it to `grep LISTEN`

---

Tcpdump
=======

Let's capture the raw packets going across the network:

~~~ bash
sudo tcpdump -A -i lo -l port 3000 > tcpdump.out &
curl http://username:password@http-workshop.boochtek.com
less tcpdump.out
~~~

Let's find the password that went across the wire:

~~~ bash
cat tcpdump.out | grep Basic | cut -d' ' -f3 | base64 -d
~~~

???

You can capture with `tcpdump` and view in Wireshark

---

Logs
====

Pick some previous exercises and run them while watching Rails logs

Hint: Use `tail -f`, `tailf`, or `less +F`

* Tip: Use `tmux` to run multiple things in separate "windows"

???

Bonus: Do the same for the Nginx and Squid proxy logs
