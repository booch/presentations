class: http-response

HTTP Response
=============

<pre><code>HTTP/1.0 <span class="status_code">201</span> Created
<span class="headers">Location: https://www.google.com/</span>
<span class="headers">Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8</span>
<span class="blank"> </span>
<span class="body">{"rubyconf": "awesome", "day": 3}</span>
</code></pre>

<ul>
  <li><span class="status_code">Status code</span></li>
  <li><span class="headers">Headers</span></li>
  <li><span class="body">Body</span></li>
</ul>

???

* Status line - contains protocol, status code, and status description

---

Response Status Codes
=====================

* 100s - Informational
* 200s - Success
  * 200 - OK
  * 201 - Created
* 300s - Redirection
  * 301 - Moved Permanently
  * 304 - Not Modified

---

Response Status Codes
=====================

* 400s - Client Error
  * 401 - Unauthorized
  * 403 - Forbidden
  * 404 - Not Found
  * 407 - Proxy Authentication Required
  * 422 - Unprocessable Entity
* 500s - Server Error
  * 500 - Internal Server Error
  * 502 - Bad Gateway
  * 504 - Gateway Timeout

???

* 405 - Method Not Allowed
* 418 - I'm a teapot

---

Response Headers
================

* Content-Encoding
* Content-Length
* Content-Disposition
* Content-Type
* Location
* Set-Cookie
* WWW-Authenticate

---

Proxies
=======

* Proxy - to act in place of another


* Web proxies intercept HTTP requests
  * Can modify the request or response
  * Can modify headers or body content

---

Proxies
=======

* Good for caching
* Can add security
  * SSL termination / offloading
  * Authentication


* Transparent vs. non-transparent
* Reverse vs. forward

---

CDNs
====

* Content delivery network
* Caching proxies for static content
* Content is distributed
* Content is placed closer to more clients
* BGP Anycast for DNS servers
  * Determines which content server is closest

* DDoS protection

---

Troubleshooting
===============

* ping
* traceroute
* telnet
* netstat -plant
* openssl s_client (HTTPS)
* tcpdump
* Wireshark

???

* Mac `netstat` takes only `-na`, not `-plt`
  * Pipe it to `grep LISTEN`

* You can capture with `tcpdump` and view in Wireshark

---

HTTP/2
======

* SPDY
* Header compression (HPACK)
* TLS required by every implementation
  * Not really related to HTTP/2
  * Probably due to use of ALPN TLS extension
* Binary framing instead of text-based
  * Same semantics as HTTP/1.1 though

???

* ALPN = Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation

---

HTTP/2
======

* Multiplexed connections
  * Grab multiple resources simultaneously
    * Over a single TCP connection
* Server push
* Removes the need to combine JS, CSS, and images
* Starts with an HTTP/1.1 connection using `Upgrade` and `HTTP2-Settings` headers
  * Returns a 101 status code (Switching Protocols)

---

HTTP/2 - Support
================

* Chrome 41
* Firefox 36
* IE 11 - only in Windows 10
* Nginx will support it by the end of 2015
  * 1.5.10 supports SPDY/3.1
* cURL 4.x
  * With `--http2` flag, if feature compiled in
* Wireshark 1.99
* Apache seems to have no plans, but mod_spdy is available

???

* Unfortunately, I couldn't get cURL and Nginx to cooperate
  * Had to compile OpenSSL 1.0.2 and cURL 7.41 with nghttp2
  * They used NPN instead of ALPN

---

Exercises
=========

---

Start Vagrant
=============

Change to the directory containing and `http_exploration.box`

~~~ bash
vagrant box add http_exploration ./http_exploration.box
vagrant init http_exploration
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
~~~

When you're done, stop the VM with `vagrant halt`

---

Telnet - HTTP/0.9
=================

Use telnet, but don't specify a version of HTTP in the request

~~~ bash
telnet localhost 3000
~~~

~~~
GET http://localhost/
~~~

Note that you couldn't specify request headers
Note that there are no response headers

---

Telnet - HTTP/1.0
=================

Use telnet, and specify HTTP/1.0 in the request

~~~ bash
telnet localhost 3000
~~~

~~~
GET http://localhost:3000/ HTTP/1.0
Host: localhost

~~~

Note that you need a blank line after the last header

---

Telnet - HTTP/1.1
=================

Use telnet, and specify HTTP/1.1 in the request

~~~ bash
telnet localhost 3000
~~~

~~~
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost

~~~

Note that you can simplify the request line (except HTTP/0.9)

What's different about this, compared to HTTP/1.0?
  * Hint: Hit Control+C

---

Wget
====

Use wget

~~~ bash
wget -d http://localhost:3000/
~~~

Where did it put the result?

Tip: Use `-o` to specify the output file

???

* Mac Homebrew wget doesn't support `-d` out of the box
  * `brew reinstall wget --with-debug`

---

cURL
====

Use cURL

~~~ bash
curl -v http://localhost:3000/
curl -v http://localhost:3000/reflect
~~~

Note the leading `*`, `>`, and `<` characters
  * What does each prefix character mean?

---

HTTPie
======

Use HTTPie

~~~ bash
http -v http://localhost:3000/
http -v http://localhost:3000/reflect X-RailsConf-Date:2015-04-23
http --style=xcode -v http://localhost:3000/
~~~

What's different about this ouput compared to cURL?
  * Which do you prefer?

---

Redirect
========

Let's see what a redirect looks like

~~~ bash
curl -v http://localhost:3000/redirect
http -v --follow http://localhost:3000/redirect
~~~

Notice the status code and `Location` header

Now let's follow the redirect

~~~ bash
curl -v -L http://localhost:3000/redirect
~~~

---

POST
====

Let's see what a POST looks like

~~~ bash
curl -v -X POST http://localhost:3000/post -d key=value -d railsconf=fun
http -v POST http://localhost:3000/post key=value railsconf=fun
~~~

Note the request body being sent

---

HTTPS - Telnet
==============

Try to telnet to an HTTPS server:

~~~ bash
telnet www.google.com 443
~~~

~~~
GET / HTTP/1.0
Host: www.google.com

~~~

What happens? Why?

---

HTTPS - OpenSSL
===============

Try using OpenSSL `s_client` instead:

~~~ bash
openssl s_client -connect www.google.com:443
~~~

~~~
GET / HTTP/1.0
Host: www.google.com

~~~

Tip: Check out the `-pause` and `-debug` options to `s_client`

---

HTTPS - HTTPie
==============

Try using HTTPie instead:

~~~ bash
http -v HEAD https://www.google.com/
~~~

---

HTTPS - cURL
============

Try using cURL instead:

~~~ bash
curl -v -X HEAD https://www.google.com/
~~~

---

Netstat
=======

See what services are listening:

~~~ bash
sudo netstat -plant
~~~

---

Proxy - Squid
=============

Proxy your requests through Squid (running on port 3128):

~~~ bash
curl -v --proxy localhost:3128 http://localhost:3000/
curl -v --proxy localhost:3128 http://localhost:3000/reflect
http -v --proxy http:http://localhost:3128 http://localhost:3000/
http_proxy=http://localhost:3128 curl -v http://localhost:3000/
~~~

What did the proxy change?

Bonus: Take a look at the bottom of `/etc/squid3/squid.conf`

---

Proxy - Nginx
=============

Use Nginx as a reverse proxy to add TLS security:

~~~ bash
curl -v --insecure https://localhost/
http -v --verify=no https://localhost/
~~~

Note: We're ignoring invalid SSL certs here -- never do this!
  * You would be vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack

Note that we've configured Nginx to use SSL and proxy to port 3000

Bonus: Take a look at the bottom of `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`

---

HTTP/2
======

Use cURL to hit Google using HTTP/2:

~~~ bash
curl -v --http2 -X HEAD https://www.google.com/
~~~

Note: We had to manually compile OpenSSL and cURL to make this work
  * We still couldn't get it to work against Nginx's SPDY
