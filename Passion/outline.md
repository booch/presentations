# Passion + Giving = Purpose

## Intro

* August 9, 2014
* I read a (re)tweet from Alex Harms about a shooting and unrest in Ferguson
* My first thought was "please don't be Ferguson, Missouri"
* An unarmed 18-year-old black kid had been shot and killed by police
* ![Michael Brown](TODO)

### My Relationship to Ferguson
* ![Map showing Ferguson, where Michael Brown was shot, and where I grew up](TODO)
* I grew up 6 miles from Ferguson
* ![Sound Warehouse](TODO)
* Me and my best friend from high school liked to go to the record store nearby
* ![Barber shop](TODO)
* My grandpa and great-grandfather had barber shops in Ferguson
* ![My great-grandma's house on Tiffin](TODO)
* I remember visiting my great-grandma there
	* My mom said she liked to visit there when she was a kid, because they had squirrels
* [Collage of news about Mike Brown and Ferguson](TODO)
* I was glued to the news for a couple weeks
* I cried several times that week
* I was sad
* I was angry
* I felt helpless
* The only difference between me and the rioters was that I was not oppressed
	* I was a part of the system that supported oppression
* So many people were hurting, feeling oppressed

### Looking for Answers
* ![Most Holy Trinity Catholic Church](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/55312c5ee4b006a717072900/t/5655e834e4b0c6e18e297685/1448470580500/Most+Holy+Trinity+powerlines+removed.jpg)
* The next Sunday, I went to my dad's church
	* This is the church you can see from I-70 between downtown and North Grand
* ![Cahokia Mounds](http://www.daviddarling.info/images/Monks_Mound.jpg)
* I went to Cahokia Mounds
	* It's a place where I'd found some spiritual connection before
* I was looking for answers
* I was looking for meaning
* I didn't find either

### Mike Brown Funeral Service (Optional)
* ![Krispy Kreme store](http://www.ksdk.com/img/resize/content.ksdk.com/photo/2016/05/03/GettyImages-703389_1462309757969_2084318_ver1.0.jpg?preset=mb_large)
* On my way home, I was passing by Ferguson
* I decided to stop at the Krispy Kreme at 270 and West Florissant
* ![Mike Brown funeral service](http://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140825130204-14-brown-funeral-0825-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg)
* Traffic was crazy - I'd accidentally stumbled across Mike Brown's funeral service
* ![Krispy Kreme donuts](https://h2savecom.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/krispy-kreme-donuts.png?w=1024&h=538)
* So I bought a dozen donuts
	* I ate a couple myself
	* I handed out the rest as I walked half a mile from where I had parked
* [Mike Brown funeral service - inside](https://www.vosizneias.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/h_51535417.jpg) 
* The church was packed to overflowing
* [Mike Brown funeral service - outside](http://images.gawker.com/cfwo9p1htxyzhhhtqrwx/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800.jpg) 
* The parking lot was packed with even more people
* They had radio trucks with speakers for us to hear outside
* ![Collage of pictures I took in the parking lot](TODO)
* I learned a lot that day

## Black Lives Matter
* ![BLACK LIVES MATTER](TODO)
* This is what I believe
* When we say it, we mean this:
* ![BLACK LIVES MATTER AS MUCH AS WHITE LIVES](TODO)
* Not this:
* ![ONLY BLACK LIVES MATTER](TODO)

### Marching
* ![Marching in Ferguson](TODO)
* I marched in a couple protests
* ![Wesley Buchek being arrested at a peaceful protest at St. Louis Galleria](TODO)
* My brother has been more active than me
* He's one of the ones who got arrested with no provocation or warning at the Galleria
	* (a local shopping mall in a more affluent part of the county)
* ![Marching in Ferguson](TODO) 
* I was there mainly to support the voices who aren't being heard
* I learned a lot
* But I didn't feel like I was really making an impact, or using my talents

## Hands Up United Tech Impact
* ![Ferguson protesters with their hands up](TODO)
* One of the chants in Ferguson was "hands up, don't shoot"
* It's clear to me that Mike Brown's hands were up when he was shot
* ![White construction worker saying "he had his hands up"](TODO - clip from http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/10/us/ferguson-michael-brown-shooting-witnesses/index.html)
* Here's why I believe that
* But even if they weren't, police are not judge, jury, and executioner
* There's no good reason to "shoot to kill" an unarmed person

* ![Hands Up United logo](TODO)
* One group formed in response was named Hands Up United
* ![ThoughtWorks logo](To-do) 
* ThoughtWorks sent down some of their employees to help the organizers
* Some of the kids volunteering said they wanted to support local businesses, but they couldn't find them on the web
* ![Phone book - Yellow pages](TODO)
* And phone books weren't a thing any more
* So they decided to figure out how to teach themselves to make web sites for the mom and pop shops in their community

* ![Tweet about a GoFundMe page raising money to teach underprivileged kids how to build web sites](TODO)
* Alex Miller tweeted about a GoFundMe page raising money to teach underprivileged kids how to build web sites
* My wife was going to school, so we didn't have much money to give
* But I had time and expertise to share
* It sounded like the perfect role for me
	* It allowed me to apply my experience and skills
	* It felt like something that could make a difference
	* It was so compelling - a calling

### Mentoring the kids
* Hard work and lots of hours
* Had to give up some of the time I spent elsewhere

### The lightbulb moment

### Exceeding my expectations
* ![OPPORTUNITY]
* My goal was to give the kids an opportunity that they would not have had otherwise - a chance to learn enough to decide if this was a path for them or not
* Opportunity is the biggest thing missing in most of these kids' lives
* They probably don't have the privilege of knowing anyone in their network, or their parents' network that could introduce them to this as a career path
* I didn't expect a very high chance that any of the kids would pursue this as a career
* But some of the kids continued building websites for small companies in their communities, setting up a small side business
* We gave these kids a chance, and they exceeded our expectations

## Community
* ![Alex Harms](TODO) ![Tweet I first saw referring to Ferguson](TODO)
* In the middle of writing this talk, I noticed something
* I'd meet Alex Harms at Midwest Ruby 2012?
* ![Alex Miller](TODO) ![Tweet I first saw referring to Tech Impact program](TODO)
* I'd met Alex Miller at local meetups
* ![Strange Loop logo](TODO)
* He founded Lambda Lounge and Strange Loop
* ![Idalin Bobé giving keynote at Strange Loop](TODO)
* He later had Idalin Bobé give a keynote at Strange Loop
* ![ThoughtWorks logo](To-do)
* ThoughtWorks is a company I've admired for years
* ![Heidi Helfand](TODO)
* When I went to RubyConf 2017, Heidi Helfand (from ProCore) asked us about a "peak moment" in our lives to share with a neighbor in the audience
* That light bulb moment was my story
* I told her that story when we happened to sit at the same table at lunch the next day

* ![COMMUNITY]
* The common thread - these are my communities
* Some I chose, some chose me
* I think this country has forgotten how to be a community
* But I see signs of hope
* The tech community I involve myself in works to make a difference
	* Many of us are trying to improve diversity and inclusion
* ![Approximately 700,000 pixels, representing each hour of my life](TODO)
* Andy Croll gave a keynote at RubyConf 2017, showing a pixel for every hour of our lives - it's only enough pixels to fill a 1024x768 screen
* So use each pixel wisely
* Find your community
* Find people that are nice and help each other
* Find the place where you can make a difference
* Put in the work, because the rewards are high
	* How you feel about yourself
	* The impact on someone else's life
	* The impact you make to improve the communities you live in
* Make every pixel - every hour - count
* ![BLACK LIVES MATTER]
* Make every person count (whether you've met them or not)
* Reach out to meet people you wouldn't normally cross paths with
* Work to improve our communities
	* This one right here
	* The wider (local) community
	* Our state, our country, our world
