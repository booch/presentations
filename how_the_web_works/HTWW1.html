Why Did HTTP Beat Gopher?
=========================

* University of Michigan was going to charge for the server software
  * WorldWideWeb was made public domain in 1991
* Early web browsers included Gopher functionality
* HTML pages are more free-form
  * Gopher was hierarchical
  * Gopher is more like a list of docs you can download
    * Sort of like FTP with an HTML interface

???

* Demo Gopher through HTTP proxy: http://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/
  * Click on a few things on the right
  * Maybe do some searches

---

Browsers
========

* Browser - software running on *your* computer to access web sites

* [WorldWideWeb] - 1991
* NCSA Mosaic - 1992/1993
* Netscape Navigator - 1994
* Internet Explorer - 1995
* Opera - 1996
* Netscape Communicator - 1997
* Mozilla - 1998
* Mozilla Firefox - 2002
* Safari - 2003
* Google Chrome - 2008

Browsers - Non-Graphical
========================

* Lynx
* Links
* Elinks
* w3m

???

* Demo a couple of these

---

User Agents
===========

* Technical term for a web client
* Includes:
  * Browsers
  * Web spiders
  * Downloaders
  * Command-line clients
    * Curl
    * Wget
    * HTTPie

???

* Show some user agent strings
  * http://www.useragentstring.com/
  * http://www.useragentstring.com/pages/useragentstring.php

---

Web Servers
===========

* Web Server - hardware system or software used to provide web sites

* WorldWideWeb
* CERN httpd - 1990
* NCSA httpd - c 1992
* Netscape Enterprise Server - 1994
* Apache httpd - 1995
* Microsoft IIS - c. 1995
* Nginx - 2002

---

Web Applications
================

* Web App - a web site that "does something"

---

Web Applications - Server Side
==============================

* Application Server - web server software designed for web apps
  * Apache Tomcat
  * tc Server (Pivotal, VMware, Spring)
* Server-side languages
  * PHP
* Application frameworks
  * Ruby on Rails
  * ASP.NET

---

Web Applications - Client Side
==============================

* Single-page apps (SAP)
* AJAX
* Frameworks
  * Backbone
  * Angular
  * Ember
  * React

---

HTML
====

* Hypertext Markup Language

* The markup language that web pages are written in
* Tags for different things
  * Each has a meaning, independent from the way it is displayed

???

* Demo the HTML of this page

---

CSS
===

* CSS describes how the HTML should look

???

* Demo the CSS for this page

---

JavaScript
==========

* On (almost) every browser
  * De facto language for client-side programming
* Brandon Eich at Netscape
  * Written in 10 days 
* Originally designed for client and server
  * Node brings it back to the server side
* Much hated at first
* Now [tolerated] or liked

[tolerated]: http://i.imgur.com/wR3ZxfB.jpg

???

* Demo the JavaScript for this page

---

Web 2.0
=======

* Coined by Tim O'Reilly
* Noticed a qualitative difference in web sites
* More interactive, dynamic, participatory
* Web "as a platform"
* Different look and feel
* AJAX

---

HTML 5
======

* Recent update to the standards
  * HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* Helps write client-side web apps more easily

---

How Does the Browser Talk to the Server?
========================================

* URL is interpretted and broken into pieces
* Web server is determined
* Name of web server is looked up
  * DNS query / resolution
* Browser communicates with server via HTTP

---

URLs
====

* RFC 3986
* URL versus URI
  * URL - provide a means of locating the resource by describing its primary access mechanism
    * Used to *access* the resource
  * URI - identifies a resource
    * Used for identifiers without going to get the resource
  * URN - non-network resource hierarchy
  * IRI (International Resource Identifiers) - the extension of URI syntax to non-ASCII
    * PunyCode

---

* URN example: ISBN number for a specific edition of a book
  * urn:isbn:0-486-27557-4
* More URL examples:
  * urn:ietf:rfc:2648
  * urn:uuid:6e8bc430-9c3a-11d9-9669-0800200c9a66
  * urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.9954 (BoochTek's Private Enterprise Number (PEN) registered with the IANA)
    * Used for SNMP MIBs, LDAP, DHCP options, and other places
* All URLs are URIs (with some possible caveats)
* Not all URIs are URLs
* All URNs are URIs
* An example of a URI that's not a URL is the "system identifier" portion of an HTML/SGML DOCTYPE
  * For example http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd
    * Although this particular one DOES have content at that URL
* Another example is an XML namespace
  * TODO: Show an example (preferably one that has no content at the URL)

URL Components
==============

~~~
http://user:pword@example.com:8080/abc/index.php?type=prod&name=cd#price
\__/   \________/ \_________/ \__/\____________/\________________/\____/
  |        |           |       |       |                |           |
  |     userinfo      host    port    path            query      fragment
  |    \_________________________/
scheme            |
              authority
~~~

* Scheme (protocol)
* Host (server)
* Port
* Path
* Query string
* Fragment
