# Architecture Big and Small

This is my presentation for [Madison Ruby+ 2024, August 1-2](https://www.madisonruby.com/).

Here's the [CFP proposal](proposal.md).

This is currently a [work in progress](TODO.md).

[Slides are written in Markdown](slides.md).

Here's the [slide show](slides.html).

I'm using [some AI](AI-prompts.md) to help me create the slides, and to find good examples.

## Abstract

We use the term "architecture" in computer programming quite a bit. But is it a valid and useful analogy (or borrowing of the term)? What could we learn by taking another look at the architecture of buildings?

We'll take a look at the history of patterns in building architecture, and how our industry adopted a similar way of thinking. What have we missed? Why do we only consider large architectural issues, and ignore smaller issues that still might be considered architectural?
