???

- This is actually part of a series
    - A Pattern Language (1977, vol 2)
        - We'll focus on this book

    - The Timeless Way of Building (1979, vol 1)
        - goes hand-in-hand with the Pattern Language book
        - philosophical approach to architecture
        - introduces the concept of the "quality without a name"
            - we should seek to include this nameless quality in our buildings
    - The Oregon Experiment (1975, vol 3)
        - experimental approach to campus community planning
            - University of Oregon
            - testbed for ideas in the later 2 books
        - People centric
            - "feeling" should be the primary criterion used for making changes to any place
            - people can and should be involved in the design process of their spaces
        - resulted in a theory of architecture and planning

# Software Design Pattern

- General solution to a common problem
- Not an algorithm
- Not code
- Blue-print of the outline of a solution

???

- Not code - cannot be copied and pasted
- Not an algorithm - not that specific

---

# Software Design Pattern

- Name
- Intent
- Context
- Problem
- Solution
- Cross-references

???

- Patterns help us use a common language to describe solutions to common problems
- Intent: What are we trying to accomplish?
- Context: Conditions under which the pattern holds
- Problem: "System of forces" that leads towards some goal
- Solution: configuration that balances the system of forces

---

# Software Design Pattern - Examples

- Singleton
- Factory
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor
- Null Object

???

- A singleton is a class that can only be instantiated once
- A factory is a class or method that creates objects
- A strategy is a class that provides an algorithm that can be swapped out
- A template method provides a default implementation that can be overridden
- A visitor is used to iterate over a collection of objects
- A null object is used to provide a default implementation that does nothing

---

# Software Design Pattern - Example

- [Null Object](https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/null_object)

---

# Software Design Pattern Categories

- Creational
- Structural
- Behavioral
- Concurrency
- Architectural

???

- Creational patterns create objects
- Structural patterns organize classes and objects to form larger structures
- Behavioral patterns provide communication between objects
- Concurrency patterns deal with multi-threading
- Architectural patterns deal with high-level structure

---

# Software Design Patterns - Criticism

- Overuse
- Wrong context
- Limited reusability
- Missing language features
- Paradigm-specific
- Not a substitute for experience
- Not a silver bullet

???

- The first problem is that many developers misunderstand patterns
    - They try to take patterns and apply them to every problem
    - Instead, we need to think of patterns as a common language to describe solutions to common problems
    - Patterns can be very context-dependent
- Reuse often isn't possible
    - We have to write the pattern every time
    - Components are a better way to reuse code
- Many patterns are just a replacement for missing language features
    - For example, in machine language, a "subroutine" was a pattern
    - In Ruby, we have `Enumerable`, so we don't need the Iterator or Visitor pattern as much
    - In Ruby, mixins are just part of the language, so we don't think of them as a pattern
    - In Ruby, dependency injection just feels like passing in a parameter (with a default)
- Most of the patterns in the GoF book are object-oriented
- And of course, patterns are not a substitute for experience

---

# Missing Language Features

~~~ java
Iterator it = nodes.iterator();
while (it.hasNext()) {
    Node node = (Node) it.next();
    node.doSomething();
}
~~~

~~~ ruby
nodes.each { |node| node.doSomething }
~~~

- Inspired by Alexander's work
    - Extensive work with Christopher Alexander
- 6-part TV series for the BBC
    - Aired in July-August 1997 on BBC2

![book cover - How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They’re Built](images/How-Buildings-Learn.jpg)

???

- **This all applies to software as well!**
    - Incremental change
    - Learning as you go
    - Choose the option that gives more options in the future
    - Adaptation to changing needs
    - "Maintenance is a form of evolution"
    - Buildings are predictions
        - All predictions are wrong
        - Ergo, design so that it doesn't matter when they're wrong
    - A building is never finished
    - [Shearing layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shearing_layers)
        - SITE: changes every 50-500 years
        - STRUCTURE: foundation & load-bearing, rarely changed
        - SKIN: changes every 20 years, air-tight, better insulated
        - SERVICES: changes every 7-15 years
        - SPACE PLAN: interior layout, walls, ceilings, floors, doors. changes every 3-30 years
        - STUFF: "mobilia" in Italian

---
class: single-image

![book cover - How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They’re Built](images/How-Buildings-Learn.jpg)

???

- We shape our buildings, and our buildings shape us
    - Adaptation between buildings and users is slow and continuous process
- Over 50 years, the changes within a building cost more than the original building
    - 3x more for a commercial building
    - 6x more for a residential building
- Hire good builders and save money in the long run
- "temporary" is permanent most of the time
- Fail small, early, and often, and you will succeed in the long run

- "A new building is a bad teacher of maintenance habits, since deferring of maintenance is habit. A building that has been maintained for a long time is a good teacher, since its maintenance is a habit."

- In many fields, "architecture" means "unchanging deep structure".

- TODO: More!

---
# Large vs Small

???

- We think of architecture as "big"
    - Buildings
    - Cities
    - Software systems
- But we can also think of "small" architecture
    - Rooms
    - Software components

---
class: single-image

![Door knob and door lever](images/door_knob_vs_door_lever.jpg)

???

- I was surprised that Alexander's book didn't cover this
- Door knobs are a relatively recent invention
    - 1878
    - Lever handles are much older
- I found 2 web pages that help choose which to use
    - Knobs have more styles available
    - Knobs can turn either way
    - Levers are easier to use
    - Levers can be used with your hands are full
    - Levers are easier for young people, old people, disabled people
    - Levers can easily snag on clothing

![Material Design Buttons](images/material-design-buttons.webp)

???

- We rarely think of a button as an architectural element
- But an architectural element is anything that is part of the structure of an application
        - or building
- We should choose the right button for the right context
    - We should not have a "one-size-fits-all" button
    - But we should not have every button be different

---

# Conclusions

- Patterns are a way to describe solutions to common problems
- Pattern languages give us a common language
- Architecture is about structure
- We can't predict what our future needs will be
    - So we need to design for change, evolution, and adaptation
    - Learning, habit, prediction, 
    - The majority of the costs are in maintenance 
- Architecture is about people
    - How they interact with a space or a software application
