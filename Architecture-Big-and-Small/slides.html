# Architecture

# Big and Small

???

- Hi, I'm Craig
    - Today, I'm going to talk about "architecture", "design", and "patterns"
- If you want to "at" me, ...
    - I'm on Twitter and Mastodon via ruby.social
        - ... infrequently
- I have a short URL for the slides in the lower right.
    - Follow along, or look at them later
    - Hit `P` to toggle presenter notes
        - Also links to resources
        - ... and some details that I don't have time to cover

- What is a pattern language?

---
# Pattern Language

> A pattern language is an organized and coherent set of patterns ... that can be used in many ways within a specific field of expertise. <cite>-- Wikipedia</cite>

???

- Wikipedia says it well
    - A pattern language is an organized and coherent set of patterns ...
        - ... that can be used in many ways within a specific field of expertise.
- Maybe more of a "vocabulary" or "glossary" for a specific field

------

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_language

---
class: single-image

![book cover - A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction](images/A-Pattern-Language.jpg)

???

- Every person and organization should have its own pattern language
    - But they should consist of mostly common patterns
- "A pattern language has the structure of a network." -- Christopher Alexander
    - Mathematical term: Graph
    - Patterns reference each other
        - ... creating a network of relationships amongst them
        - Build on others
        - Are built on top of others
- Patterns and languages are alive - constantly evolving

---
# Pattern

???

- But what is a pattern?

---
# Pattern

> Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the **core** of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

???

- A Pattern Language, page _x_ (emphasis mine):
    - "Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the **core** of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice."

---
# Pattern

- Common problem
- Context
- Solution
    - Invariants
    - Essence

???

- Description of a **common** problem
- Considers various "forces"
    - Constraints
    - Context
- Solution needs to balance these forces
    - One definition of engineering!
- Invariants/essence of solution
    - Common properties of all "good" solutions

---
# Pattern

- Hypothesis

???

- A hypothesis
    - Varying amounts of evidence
    - Some eventually proven wrong
    - Might be replaced by a better pattern

---
# Pattern

- Communication

???

- Common language for communicating within field

---
# Examples

- 2: The Distribution Of Towns
- 4: Agricultural Valleys
- 9: Scattered Work
- 10: Magic Of The City
- 12: Community Of 7000
- 14: Identifiable Neighborhood
- 17: Ring Roads
- 22: Nine Per Cent Parking
- 25: Access To Water

- 78: House For One Person
- 128: Indoor Sunlight
- 129: Common Areas At The Heart

- 140: Private Terrace On The Street
- 155: Old Age Cottage
- 177: Vegetable Garden
- 178: Compost
- 193: Half-Open Wall
- 203: Child Caves

---
# Example: Four-Story Limit

- There is abundant evidence to show that high buildings make people crazy.
- Therefore: In any urban area, no matter how dense, keep the majority of buildings four stories high or less. It is possible that certain buildings should exceed this limit, but they should never be buildings for human habitation.

- He cites multiple studies on effects of high-rise buildings
    - Kids on high floors get outside less
        - Compared to kids on lower floors
    - Kids on high floors have less social interaction

- Visitor

???

- These are all OOP patterns
    - They all involve classes and objects
- FP, procedural, and logic programming generally have their own patterns
    - They have different patterns to do similar things
    - Or don't need to do the thing at all
        - Or it's just a language feature

# Software Design Pattern

- General solution to a common problem
- Not code
- Not an algorithm
- Blue-print of the outline of a solution

???

- How are software design patterns different?
    - Not much!
    - Common problem
    - Context
    - Solution

- Not code - cannot be copied and pasted
- Not an algorithm - not that specific
- Can be at any level of abstraction
    - From a single line of code to a whole system
- Often a "best practice"

---
# Software Design Pattern

- Name
- Intent
- Context
- Problem
- Solution
- Cross-references

???

- Same format as Christopher Alexander used
    - Roughly

---
# Architecture

> the complex or carefully designed structure of something

???

- Dictionary definition of "architecture"
- In many fields, "architecture" means "unchanging deep structure"

---
class: single-image, wide

![AI-generated picture of a majestic ornate building](images/Majestic-ornate-building.webp)

???

- We think of architecture as "big"
    - Buildings
    - Cities
    - Software systems

---
class: single-image

![Ornate details on a building](images/ornate-detail.jpg)

???

- But structure is fractal
    - We can see zoom in
    - See patterns at all levels
- But we can also think of "small" architecture
    - Rooms
    - Alcoves
    - Software components

---
class: single-image, wide

![Door knob and door lever](images/door_knob_vs_door_lever.jpg)

???

- For example, door knobs are an architectural element
    - Many famous architects have designed door knobs
        - I found knobs by Gaudi, Eames, Frank Lloyd Wright, and others

- I found 2 web pages that help choose between these 2 options
    - Levers are easier to use
    - Levers can be used with your hands are full
    - Levers are easier for young people, old people, disabled people
    - Levers can easily snag on clothing
    - Knobs have more styles available
    - Knobs can turn either way

------

- https://www.suffolklatchcompany.com/blogs/news/door-knobs-or-door-handles
- https://www.parkavenuelocks.com/blog/post/door-knobs-vs-door-levers-ending-the-debate

- I was surprised that Alexander's book didn't cover door knobs/handles

- Modern door knobs are a relatively recent invention!
    - 1878
    - Lever handles are much older

---

![Material Design Buttons](images/material-design-buttons.webp)

???

- We rarely think of a button as an architectural element
- Part of the structure of an app
- Same kinds of decisions
    - Constraints
    - Context
    - Users interacting with them
- We want consistency
    - When contexts are similar

# How Buildings Learn

- A building is never finished
- Adapt to changing needs
- Design for change
- Change incrementally
- Learn as we go
- Maintenance is a form of evolution

???

- Do these sound familiar?
    - **Nearly all the lessons apply to software as well!**

- This sounds like Agile to me
    - Not the watered-down Scrum that we end up with
    - Incremental change
    - Focus on users
    - Adapting

---
class: single-image

![book cover - How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They’re Built](images/How-Buildings-Learn.jpg)

???

- "Buildings are predictions"
    - All predictions are wrong
    - Ergo, design so that it doesn't matter when we're wrong
- Choose options that provide more options in the future

------

- [Shearing layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shearing_layers)
    - SITE: changes every 50-500 years
    - STRUCTURE: foundation & load-bearing, rarely changed
    - SKIN: changes every 20 years, air-tight, better insulated
    - SERVICES: changes every 7-15 years
    - SPACE PLAN: interior layout, walls, ceilings, floors, doors. changes every 3-30 years
    - STUFF: "mobilia" in Italian

---
class: single-image

![book cover - How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They’re Built](images/How-Buildings-Learn.jpg)

???

- We shape our buildings, and our buildings shape us
    - Adaptation between buildings and users is slow and continuous process
- Over 50 years, the changes within a building cost more than the original building
    - 3x more for a commercial building
    - 6x more for a residential building
- Hire good builders and save money in the long run
- "temporary" is permanent most of the time
- Fail small, early, and often, and you will succeed in the long run

------

- "A new building is a bad teacher of maintenance habits, since deferring of maintenance is habit. A building that has been maintained for a long time is a good teacher, since its maintenance is a habit."

---
# Conclusions

- Pattern languages help us communicate
    - Solutions to common problems

???

---
# Conclusions

- Architecture is about structure
- Architecture is about people
    - Interactions is space and time
    - Interactions with people and objects

???

- In many fields, "architecture" means "unchanging deep structure"
    - But architecture **does** change
- Architecture is really about people
    - And how they interact with their environment

---
# Conclusions

- We can't predict what our future needs will be
    - Design for change, evolution, adaptation
    - Learning

???

---
# Conclusions

- Smalltalk's legacy is huge
    - OOP
    - Agile
    - Design Patterns

???

- Small group of people were involved in Smalltalk, OOP, patterns, and Agile
    - Perhaps also Open Source
- Ruby is very much like Smalltalk
    - Many of these people now use Ruby
    - This is why Agile is so common in Ruby

---
# Conclusions

- We can learn from other fields

    - Members of STL Linux meetup
        - Feedback on a preview version of the talk
