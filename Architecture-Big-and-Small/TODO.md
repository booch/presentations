- Conference notes
    - "Pursue energy, not passion."
        - Lauren Auchter
    - It seems like it's (still) awkward for men and women to talk to each other at conferences
        - I'm the opposite: I prefer to talk to women
            - It's just been easier to have meaningful conversations with female friends
                - Most of my life, I've had more female friends than male friends
            - I enjoy the company of women
                - I don't mean in any kind of sexual way
                    - Well, I mean, I *do* enjoy that kind of thing too
                        - But that's not something I'm thinking about when I'm talking to women
                            - I'm just enjoying the conversation
            - I feel that women have more interesting things to say
                - Because they have a wider perspective
                    - They've had to deal with more crap
                - Their voices aren't heard as much
                    - So they have to work harder at it
                        - So they're usually more interesting
                        - They have learned to get their point across more succinctly
                    - They enjoy and appreciate when a man takes them seriously
                        - More than just that --- it's showing an interest in wanting to understand them
            - Women are generally the underdogs
                - I like to root for the underdog
        - WARNING: This whole thing feels "male gaze" adjacent

    - Add to "why me":
        - My "philosophy" of giving a talk is to target a wide audience.
        - I start with the basics.
        - I want the most junior person to not feel lost -- at least not for a while.
        - Then I dig in about as deep as I can, given the time constraints.
        - Mid-level and senior devs will get many gaps filled in.
        - Digging in deep means finding all the nuances and pitfalls.
        - I want the most expert person in the room to learn something.
        - I've been pretty successful at this lately.
- Writing
    - How I write a presentation
        - Figure out what topics I might want to talk about
            - Some might only be good enough for a local meetup.
                - That's OK. I enjoy giving those talks too.
            - Write them all down.
                - I often write them down as I think of them.
                    - Or at least try to remember them until I *need* to write them down.
            - Write up an abstract for each.
                - This is often near the deadline for a CFP.
                - I will often reuse an abstract for multiple CFPs.
                    - I even try some proposals multiples years for the same conference.
        - Submit to CFPs.
            - I hear about CFPs in several ways:
                - Emails
                - Tweets
                - Web sites that compile conferences and/or CFPs
                    - TODO: Links!
            - I submitted 7 talks to Madison Ruby+
                - and 7 to Blue Ridge Ruby
        - If a proposal is selected, I start writing the talk.
        - I start with an outline.
            - Actually, this time, I'm trying a white-boarding session instead.
        - My "philosophy" of a talk is to target as wide an audience as I can.
            - I start with the basics.
            - I want the most junior person to not feel lost -- at least not for a while.
            - Then I dig in about as deep as I can, given the time constraints.
            - Mid-level and senior devs will get many gaps filled in.
            - Digging in deep means finding all the nuances and pitfalls.
            - I want the most expert person in the room to learn something.
            - I then tie the topic into the bigger picture, to make a larger point.
                - For example,
                    - my `nil` talk concluded that we should use our tools better
                        - especially OOP and polymorphism
            - I've been pretty successful at all of this lately.
        - Voice-to-text white-boarding
            - Zettelkasten it!
        - I just realized at this conference that **I** learn the most, by far
            - I consume a lot about the topic and then distill it all down
                - to make the important parts easy to digest
            - I learn tons more details than I can convey in 30/45/x minutes
            - I read/watch a lot on the topic
                - To find the nuggets of ideas
    - Words:
        - remember/member/demember/unmember
        - overwhelmed/underwhelmed/whelmed

    - Private site for solo devs to find legacy projects

## White-boarding

TODO: Give this to ChatGPT to suggest slide titles and order.

- Where did design patterns come from?
- How/when/why did design patterns get to software engineering?
- Conclusion: Patterns are everywhere
    - Architecture isn't just about the big stuff
    - We ignore "architecture in the small" at our own peril
    - We can learn a lot from other fields
- Conclusion: Build for change and adaptability
    - We don't know what the future needs of the building/app will be
    - Build it well the first time
- We use the term "architecture" in software engineering quite a bit.
- Is this a valid and useful analogy (or borrowing of the term)?
- What could we learn by taking another look at the architecture of buildings?
- What have we missed?
- Why do we only consider large architectural issues?
    - and ignore smaller issues that still might be considered architectural
- History of patterns in building architecture
- How our industry adopted a similar way of thinking

## How to get the audience to engage

0. Hand out snacks?
1. Hook
    - Ask a question
    - Shocking statistic
    - Start with a story
    - Analogy or metaphor
2. Transition from the hook into the topic
3. Introduce yourself?
4. Preview/agenda
    - Remember that many people will be watching the video
5. Tell the audience what to expect to gain
6. Don't take questions (at a conference talk)
    - They're always awkward
    - Provide lots of ways for people to follow up

    Have people
