# ChatGPT - make my slides

I used ChatGPT 4o to help me with some content.
This mostly falls into a few categories:

* Getting ideas for examples
    * I then figure out which is best for getting the point across
* Automating some of boilerplate
* Generating images
    * But I usually get better results from a Google search

I'm trying to record these prompts, for a couple reasons:

* Transparency
* Attribution
* Example prompts for others to learn from

## Starting up

I'm going to give a presentation at the Madison Ruby+ Conference on August 1-2, 2024. The title is "Architecture: Big and Small". Please remember that.

I'll give more details in subsequent prompts, and ask for specific help.

### Abstract

Here is the abstract I have so far:

~~~
We use the term "architecture" in software engineering quite a bit.
But is it a valid and useful analogy (or borrowing of the term)?
What could we learn by taking another look at the architecture of buildings?
What have we missed?
Why do we only consider large architectural issues,
and ignore smaller issues that still might be considered architectural?
We'll take a look at the history of patterns in building architecture,
and how our industry adopted a similar way of thinking.
~~~

Please remember that.

### Elevator Pitch

Here is the elevator pitch I submitted in the CFP:

~~~
Patterns are everywhere. Architecture isn't just about the big stuff.
We ignore "architecture in the small" at our own peril.
We can learn a lot from other fields.
~~~

Please remember that.

### Proposal details

Here is what I submitted in the "details" section of the CFP:

~~~ markdown
* Show pictures of building architecture
    * Audience participation: Is this architecture?
    * Large things that we think of as "architecture"
    * Smaller things that we often don't think of as "architecture"
    * The pictures will be drawn from the patterns in Christopher Alexander's books
* Talk about Christopher Alexander's books
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language
    * Show and talk about some of the patterns
    * Interesting bit I learned recently:
        * He talks about how buildings change over time to adapt
            * This is a primary
* Talk about how Alexander's patterns inspired patterns in computer programming
    * Ward and Kent, according to Kevin Deisz
* Get into computer programming patterns
    * C2 Wiki
    * Gang of Four
    * SBPP (the best book on Ruby, IMHO)
    * POODR (the 2nd-best book on Ruby, IMHO)
* Talk about how some patterns are language-specific
    * Provide examples
        * In assembly language, "Call Subroutine" was a pattern
    * Are patterns just an indication of a feature missing in a language?
        * Sometimes, but not always
    * Be sure to take a look at Neal Ford's talks/work
* Talk about computer architecture "in the small"
    * Like if 3 teams have 5 ways of making a button
        * Find the best of those 5 ways, and ensure everyone uses that
        * Note that context does matter though
            * So there *may* be a reason to keep doing it more than 1 way
* Talk about idioms, and the fuzzy line between patterns and idioms
    * Similar to a "motif" in architecture
* Keep weaving in analogies with building architecture
* See if there's anything pertinent we can pull from Glenn Vanderburg's Real Software Engineering
* The main points I want to get across are:
    * Patterns are everywhere
    * Architecture isn't just about the big stuff
        * We ignore "architecture in the small" at our own peril
    * We can learn a lot from other fields

Please remember that.

### White-boarding

Here's some white-boarding I did

~~~
- What other books cover Ruby-specific patterns?
- What are some examples of patterns that are language-specific?
    - Or at least paradigm-specific?
- Are there patterns that pertain to all languages?


~~~

Please remember that.
