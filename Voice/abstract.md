# Abstract

Ever since I was 16 (1987), I dreamed of controlling my computer with my voice.
It's nearly 40 years later, and I'm not much further along in making that dream a reality.
In this 2-part series, I'll explore where we are with speaking to the computer.
Part 1 will cover dictation, voice control, and text-to-speech.
Part 2 will cover using voice with AI and coding.
