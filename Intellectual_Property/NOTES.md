Intellectual Property and Licensing - A Primer
==============================================

Abstract
--------

As web developers and designers, we deal with intellectual property (IP) all the time.
Text, images, product names, code, and algorithms all involve at least one form of IP.
In this talk, we'll learn about the primary types of IP: copyright, trademark, and patents.
We'll also explore licensing, both Open Source and proprietary.
We'll cover everything you need to know as a web developer or designer.
