# Too Late to Estimate

### Craig Buchek

## Hofstadter’s Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law

???

* I'd like to start by asking some questions
* Please yell out your answers

---

* Are you pretty good at estimating?
* Or pretty bad?

---

* Do you usually estimate too high?
* Or too low?

---

* Why do we estimate?

???

* Why are we asked for estimates?
* Answer:
    * To know how much something will cost


* Other potential answers:
    * To know when we'll be done
    * To know if we're on schedule

---

* Why do we want to know how much things will cost?

???

* Why do we want to know how much things will cost?
* Answer:
    * To know if it will be worth the cost

---

* How do we know whether it will be worth the cost?

???

* How do we know whether something will be worth the cost?
* Answer:
    * Compare the cost with the value
    * Compute the ROI

---

* ROI - Return on Investment

~~~
 value - cost       value
ROI  =  --------------  =  -------  -  1
    cost            cost
~~~

???

* ROI is the formula we use ...
    * To know whether something is worth the cost

---

* What do we want our ROI to be?

~~~
 value - cost       value
ROI  =  --------------  =  -------  -  1
    cost            cost
~~~

???

* What do we want our ROI to be?
* Answers:
    * Positive
    * Higher than the ROI of other alternatives

---

* How do we know whether we should start something?

???

* How do we know whether we should start something?
* Answers:
    * Has to have a positive ROI
    * Has to have higher ROI than alternatives

---

* Can we calculate ROI without knowing the expected value?

~~~
 value - cost       value
ROI  =  --------------  =  -------  -  1
    cost            cost
~~~

???

* If we DON'T know the value of a project ...
    * Can we figure out the ROI?
* Answer:
    * NO!

---

* Do project managers typically determine value
before asking for cost/time estimates?

???

* Do project managers usually ...
    * Determine value before asking for estimates?
* Answer:
    * No

---

* Conclusions
    * We're worse at calculating ROI than estimating
    * No point calculating ROI once we've started
    * Don't estimate at story level

???

* Once you've started the project ...
    * Too late to determine ROI
    * Too late to estimate at fine-grained level

---

* \#NoEstimates

???

* So if we don't estimate at the story level, what can we do?

---

* Estimate only at project or epic level

???

* \#NoEstimates doesn't necessarily mean **NO** estimates
* I use it to mean no **fine-grained** estimates
* Estimating at higher levels is still OK
    * Maybe even necessary

---

* Shorten the feedback loop

???

* Or we can minimize losses
* Assess **actual** ROI after each iteration
    * Stop when ROI is no longer worth it

---

* Count stories instead of story points

???

* Number of stories provides better predictive value ...
    * Than story points
* Adding points to stories is a waste of time
