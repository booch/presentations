# Too Late to Estimate

## Hofstadter’s Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law

---

* Why do we estimate?

???

* I'd like to start by asking the audience some questions
    * Yell out your answers


* Play "5 whys" with the answers
* Answers:
    * To know when we'll be done
    * To know how much it will cost
        * To know if it will be worth the cost

---

* Why do we want to know how much it will cost?

???

* Play "5 whys" with the answers

* Answers:
    * To know if it will be worth the cost

---

* How do we know whether it will be worth the cost?

???

* Answers:
    * Compare the cost with the value
    * Compute the ROI

---

* ROI - Return on Investment

~~~
 value - cost       value
ROI  =  --------------  =  -------  -  1
    cost            cost
~~~

---

* What do we want our ROI to be?

???

* Answers:
    * We want a positive ROI
    * We want the ROI to be higher than the ROI of other alternatives

---

* How do we know whether we should start a project?

???

* Answers:
    * It has to have a positive ROI
    * It has to have higher ROI than alternatives

---

~~~
 value - cost       value
ROI  =  --------------  =  -------  -  1
    cost            cost
~~~

???

* If we DON'T know the value of a project ...
    * Can we figure out the ROI?
        * NO!

---

* So why do we estimate time/cost, if we don't know value?

???

* Once you've started the project, it's too late to determine the ROI

---

* Conclusion:


* Don't estimate at fine-grained level

---

* \#NoEstimates

???

* So if we don't estimate at the story level, what can we do?

---

* Estimate only at project or epic level

???

* \#NoEstimates doesn't necessarily mean **NO** estimates
* I use it to mean no **fine-grained** estimates
* Estimating at higher levels is still OK
    * Maybe even necessary

---

* Shorten the feedback loop

???

* The other alternative is short iterations
* Work on features in order of value (as much as possible)
* Assess ROI after each iteration
    * Stop when ROI is no longer worth it
        * Compared to other projects the team could work on

---

* Try counting stories instead of story points

???

* In most cases, the number of stories can predict as much as story points
    * So adding points to stories is a waste of time
