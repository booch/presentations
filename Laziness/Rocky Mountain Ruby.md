# Rocky Mountain Ruby

## Brewing with Alan Ridlehoover & Fito von Zastrow

- Removing bitterness of complexity
- Complexity increases over time
- Method length (< 5 lines)
- Method complexity (<20 ABC) (flog score)
- Omega mess
    - big scary algorithm that never needs to change
    - leave them alone!
- "Don't make your code so DRY that ot chafes"

## Pry

- Runtime developer console
- REPL-driven development
